the start and end of sentences or words.\n\nAll this information helps a NLP neural network form an understanding of the input.\n\nThe below output shows the tokens used to encode the given test string, with `<s>` being used to indicate the start of a sequence, and each subsequent token beginning with `Ġ`, indicating the start of a new token.\n\nNote that `tokeniser` was split into two tokens `token` and `iser`, this is important for tokenisers to be able to re-use tokens wherever possible - `iser` can be used as the suffix for many different words.\n\nAn attention mask can tell the
