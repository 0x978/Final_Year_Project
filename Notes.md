# Web Scraper Advanced

## TOSDR.org
### Attempt 1: Asking
I tried to ask the TOSDR team to supply a dataset containing any summarised TOS they could provide, but after a week of no reply, I needed another approach.

### Attempt 2: Scraping
TOSDR.org offers "summarised" terms of conditions (although it's more of a uncoupled collection of points regarding the TOS)
[Terms Of Service; Didn't Read](https://edit.tosdr.org/documents)

This is pretty much my only option for summarising TOS without manually summarising 500+ examples myself.

Ultimately the design will follow the logic:

This abstracts a fair amount of logic regarding how to find TOS path, filtering out irrelevant information from scraped TOS etc
