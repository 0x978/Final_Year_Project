 Product Solutions For Remote WorkBy TeamBy Use Case Resources Effective October 13, 2023 Gather is a software as a service-based platform (the “Platform”) that enables customers to build customized Virtual Spaces (as defined in Section 2.1) and host events in those spaces or use them on a subscription basis. Gather offers the Platform with limited features for free, and we charge a fee for other uses of the Platform (the fee varies based on factors such as time and other features). We also make subscriptions of the Platform available for ongoing use. “Confidential Information” means any information, documents or data disclosed by either party that is marked or otherwise designated as confidential or proprietary. Confidential Information shall also include such information and data that should be reasonably known to be confidential. However, “Confidential Information” will not include any information which (i) is in the public domain through no fault of receiving party; (ii) was properly known to receiving party, without restriction, prior to disclosure by the disclosing party; (iii) was properly disclosed to receiving party, without restriction, by another person with the legal authority to do so; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. Confidential Information includes proprietary elements of the Platform but does not include any Customer Content created in connection with a Virtual Space. “Customer Content” includes any content and data provided by or on behalf of a Customer and any Authorized Users in relation to the access or use of the Services. Customer Content is not classified as Confidential Information as defined below. “Equipment” means all equipment and ancillary services needed to be compatible with, connect to, access or otherwise use the Service, including, without limitation, hardware, servers, software, operating systems, networks, and other services. 1.2.1. If your organization is being set up by someone who is not formally affiliated with a business entity or other organization, Customer is the individual creating the organization. If you signed up for a subscription plan using your corporate email domain or are otherwise entering into a subscription plan on behalf of a business entity or other organization, the business entity or other organization on whose behalf you signed up is the Customer. By signing up on behalf of your business entity or other organization, you represent and warrant that you have all right, power, and authority to bind such entity or organization to this Agreement. 1.2.2. Individuals authorized by Customer to access the Services (each an “Authorized User”) may submit Customer Content or information to the Services, and you will have the sole right and responsibility for managing your use of it. Customer will be solely responsible for all of the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users in relation to the Services and this Agreement. The Services are not intended for and should not be used by anyone under the age of 18. Customer must ensure that all Authorized Users are over 18 years old. 1.2.3. Customer will inform Authorized Users of all Customer policies and practices that are relevant to their use of the Services and of any settings that may impact the processing of Customer Content. By submitting, posting, storing, or otherwise making such Customer Content available through the Services, Customer grants, and represents and warrants that it has all rights necessary to grant (including without limitation any necessary consents and authorizations from individual persons identified in the Customer Content and licenses from third-parties whose content is included in the Customer Content), to Gather a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, translate, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such Customer Content, and the names, voice, and/or likeness contained in the Customer Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media, or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, solely for use in connection with our provision of the Services as described in this Agreement and our product documentation. 1.2.4. To the extent permitted under applicable law, we take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Customer Content that Customer or any Authorized User or third-party submits, posts, or otherwise makes available through the Services. As between Customer and us, Customer shall be fully responsible for the Customer Content and the consequences of submitting, posting, or otherwise making it available via the Services, and Customer acknowledges and agrees that we are acting only as a passive conduit for Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ online distribution of such Customer Content. Gather is continually modifying the Services to improve them. You acknowledge that Gather may modify the Services at its sole discretion at any time, and your only remedy for modifications that you don’t like is to stop using the Services. 2.2.1 As between the parties, Customer owns Customer Content and Customer assumes sole responsibility for all Customer’s activity in connection with the Services, such as uploading Customer Content onto the Platform. By agreeing to this Agreement, Customer agrees to provide Gather with a license to use Customer Content uploaded to the Platform only as necessary to provide the Services. Further, Customer acknowledges and agrees that we may collect data relating to Customer’s and its Authorized Users’ usage of the Services, including but not limited to how the Services are accessed and used (“Usage Data”) and collect, analyze, and use data derived from Customer Content that has been aggregated and/or anonymized such that it does not identify Customer or any identifiable individual person (“Derivative Data” and, collectively with Usage Data, “Gather Data”). All Gather Data will be owned solely and exclusively by us and, for purposes of clarity, you agree that we may use the Gather Data in perpetuity for any purpose permitted by applicable law. 2.2.2. Gather makes no representations or warranties as to the privacy of interactions in a Virtual Space or Customer Content created within or uploaded to a Virtual Space. By using the Services, you understand and acknowledge that your personal information will be collected, used and disclosed as set forth in our Privacy Policy. The privacy of a meeting depends on the conversation controls set by the Customer. 2.2.3. We care about the integrity and security of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes. You acknowledge that you provide your personal information at your own risk.

Customer agrees that it shall not: (i) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Services or any activities conducted in connection with the Services; or (ii) bypass any measures Gather may use to prevent or restrict access to the Services (or other accounts, computer systems or networks connected to the Services). 2.4.4. If Customer creates a Virtual Space, Customer is responsible for ensuring that any user that interacts within that Virtual Space is fully informed about any Customer data privacy practices (not limited to obligations related to third party scripts for analytics or tracking or other tracking measures implemented by Customer). Moreover, Customer agrees that, where required by applicable privacy laws and regulations, Customer will ensure that it obtains all necessary consents, and provides all necessary notices, for the collection or processing of personal data under any applicable data privacy laws. Throughout the term of this Agreement and at all times while Customer Confidential Information is in the possession or under the control of Gather, Gather shall establish and maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical policies, procedures and safeguards that are designed for the protection of Customer Confidential Information. Gather’s data security program is designed specifically to (i) ensure the security, integrity, availability and confidentiality of Customer’s Confidential Information, (ii) protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of Customer’s Confidential Information, and (iii) protect against the destruction, loss, unauthorized access to or alteration of Customer’s Confidential Information. Customer is responsible for (i) obtaining and maintaining any Equipment, (ii) maintaining the confidentiality and security of their Equipment, account information and credentials (“Security Credentials”), and (iii) all activities that occur using their Security Credentials unless due to the negligence or willful misconduct of Gather or its personnel. Customer may not disclose its Security Credentials to any third party except as expressly authorized in writing by Gather. Customer agrees to promptly notify Gather of any unauthorized use of its Security Credentials, account or any other breach of security. Gather reserves the right to access a Customer account in order to respond to requests for technical support. Gather shall comply with the security obligations of Section 3.1 while performing technical support obligations. You understand that certain portions of the Services, including but not limited to the Virtual Spaces, may allow users to view, edit, share, and/or otherwise interact with your Customer Content. By providing or sharing Customer Content through the Services, you agree to allow others to view, edit, share, and/or interact with Customer Content in accordance with this Agreement. Gather has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any Customer Content that is shared via the Services. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SHARE OR MAKE PUBLIC ANY CUSTOMER CONTENT YOU WISH TO KEEP CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY. GATHER TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR ANY CUSTOMER CONTENT THAT YOU OR ANY OTHER USER OR THIRD PARTY POSTS, SENDS, OR OTHERWISE MAKES AVAILABLE OVER THE SERVICES. YOU SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CUSTOMER CONTENT AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF POSTING, PUBLISHING IT, SHARING IT, OR OTHERWISE MAKING IT AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICES, AND YOU AGREE THAT GATHER IS ONLY ACTING AS A PASSIVE CONDUIT FOR YOUR ONLINE DISTRIBUTION AND PUBLICATION OF THE CUSTOMER CONTENT. 4.1.

As between the parties, Customer retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Customer Content and any intellectual property rights thereto. 4.2. Customer and its Authorized Users may choose to, or we may invite them to, submit comments or ideas about the Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products (“Feedback”). By submitting any Feedback, Customer agrees that its disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place us under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation, whether to Customer, the Authorized User, or anyone else, and/or to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. Customer further acknowledges that, by acceptance of the submission, we do not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to us, or developed by our personnel, or obtained from sources other than Customer or its Authorized Users. 4.3. Customer grants Gather the right to use Customer’s name and logo on Gather’s website, earnings releases, or marketing or promotional materials, identifying Customer as a user of the Services, subject to any standard usage guidelines Customer’s marketing team expressly provides to Gather. A subscription allows Customer and its Authorized Users to access the Services. A subscription may be procured through the Services interface, or in some cases, via an order form entered into between Customer and us (each an “Order Form”). Subscriptions commence when we make them available to Customer and continue for the term specified in the Services or in the Order Form, as applicable (the “Term”). If Customer has a subscription for the Services, said subscription shall auto-renew immediately upon the end date of the Term. For purposes of example only, if a Customer has an annual subscription, the subscription shall auto-renew for the same term length on the anniversary of the Term. If a Customer has a multi-month subscription term, then the subscription shall auto-renew for the same term length at the end of the Term. If Customer notifies Gather in writing of its request to cancel the renewal subscription prior to its auto-renewal date, then Customer subscription shall not be auto-renewed. Upon termination, Gather reserves the right (but incurs no obligation) to delete any Customer Content contained with a Virtual Space, or any Virtual Space itself. Customer may delete Customer Content itself at any time. Any section of this Agreement that, by its terms or its nature, should survive the termination or expiration of the Agreement shall so survive. 6.1.
