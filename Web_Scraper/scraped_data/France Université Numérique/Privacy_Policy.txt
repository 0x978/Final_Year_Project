You are here: Home Home The protection of your personal data (any information about you that you provide us when using the site, for example when you create a user account, such as your name, your contact information, ...) is a priority of FUN. We therefore take every precaution to ensure that no unauthorized third party has access. We only use your data to operate the platform and have no strategy to reuse or sell your data: thus, we do not sell the data of our learners, and do not give any access to third parties other than our service providers (except to the authorities or institutions producing the MOOCs -which themselves do not have the right to reuse them without your agreement for other purposes-). Without activity on your part, we will delete your identifying data after 5 years. Within the framework of our missions, among which the contribution to the experimentation and the study of the teaching practices, we can also give access to researchers to certain data of use of the platform: in this case, these are entirely pseudonymised.
