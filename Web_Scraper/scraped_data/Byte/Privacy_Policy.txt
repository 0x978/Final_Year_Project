A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which a server downloads to your personal computer (PC) or mobile device when you visit a website. The server then sends a cookie back to the originating website each time you subsequently visit it, or if you visit another website which recognises that cookie. Why do websites use cookies? Web pages have no memory. If you are surfing from page to page within a website, you will not be recognised as the same user across pages. Cookies enable your browser to be recognised by the website. So cookies are mainly used to remember the choices you have made – choices such as the language you prefer and the currency you use. They will also make sure you are recognised when you return to a website. Do all cookies do the same thing? No, there are different types of cookies and different ways of using them. Cookies can be categorised according to their function, their lifespan and according to who places them on a website. How does Bytes use cookies? Our website uses the following types of cookie: Technical cookies: We try to give our visitors an advanced and user-friendly website that adapts automatically to their needs and wishes. To achieve this, we use technical cookies to show you our website, to make it function correctly. These technical cookies are absolutely necessary for our website to function properly. Functional cookies: We also use functional cookies to remember your preferences and to help you to use our website efficiently and effectively, for example by remembering your preferred currency and language that you viewed earlier. These functional cookies are not strictly necessary for the functioning of our website, but they add functionality for you and enhance your experience. Analytics cookies: We use these cookies to gain insight into how our visitors use the website, to find out what works and what doesn’t, to optimise and improve our website and to ensure we continue to be interesting and relevant. The data we gather includes which web pages you have viewed, which referring/exit pages you have entered and left from, which platform type you have used, date and time stamp information and details such as the number of clicks you make on a given page, your mouse movements and scrolling activity, the search words you use and the text you type while using our website. We also make use of analytics cookies as part of our online advertising campaigns to learn how users interact with our website after they have been shown an online advertisement, which may include advertisements on third-party websites. We will not know who you are, and only obtain anonymous data. Commercial cookies: We use these to show you Bytes advertisements on other websites. This is called “retargeting” and it aims to be based on your browsing activities on our website, such as the destinations you have been searching for, the products you have viewed and the prices you have been shown. How long do Bytes cookies stay active? The cookies we use have varying lifespans. The maximum lifespan we set on some of them is five years from your last visit to our website. You can erase all cookies from your browser any time you want to. How can you recognise Bytes cookies? You can find our cookies in your browser settings. Does Bytes use third-party cookies? Yes, Bytes uses the services of trusted and recognised online advertising and marketing companies. Bytes may also use third-party providers for analytical purposes. To enable their services, these companies need to place cookies. The providers we use are committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. When it comes to online advertising and marketing companies, we strive to only work with companies that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) and/or the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB). Members of NAI and IAB adhere to industry standards and codes of conduct. NAI and IAB members allow you to opt out of the behavioural advertising. What essential cookies does the Software Services Portal use? Essential cookies are required for the operation of our website. You may disable these using your internet browser but this may affect website functionality. List of essential cookies used: ASPXAUTH The ASPXAUTH cookie is used to determine if a user is authenticated BasketID Session based cookie used to identify users basket ASP.NET_SessionId General purpose platform session cookie, used by sites written with Miscrosoft .NET based technologies. Usually used to maintain an anonymised user session by the server.

Used to distinguish users gstatic.com Is a cookieless domain to deliver static content for Google. ajs_user_id This cookie helps track visitor usage, events, target marketing, and can also measure application performance and stability Use of Re-Targeting Functions on the Website Activation of interest-related advertising using “re-targeting”. All Bytes websites use “re-targeting Tags” which is a JavaScript element positioned in the website source code. When a user visits a page that contains a re-targeting tag, the provider of the online advertising (e.g. Google) places a cookie on the user’s computer and organises the advertising in accordance with retargeting target group lists. This cookie is subsequently used to activate re-targeting campaigns (“Interest-related advertising“) on other websites. Studies have proven that integrating interest-related advertising is of greater interest for the Internet user than an advert which has no direct relation to the person’s interest and previously visited websites. Who has access to Bytes Technology Group cookie data? Only Bytes has access to Bytes cookies. Cookies placed by third parties can be accessed by these third parties. How can you manage your cookie preferences? Using your browser settings in, for example, Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox or Chrome, you can set which cookies to accept and which to reject. Where you find these settings depends on which browser you use. Use the “Help” function in your browser to locate the settings you need. If you choose not to accept certain cookies, you may not be able to use some functions on our website. And opting out of an online advertising network does not mean that you will no longer receive or be subject to online advertising or marketing analysis. It means that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your web preferences and browsing patterns. Does Bytes use web beacons? As well as using cookies, Bytes sometimes uses web beacons. A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that’s delivered to your computer either as part of a web page request or in an HTML email message. Either directly or through service providers, we use these pixels as part of our online advertisements either on our website or on third-party websites to learn whether a user who is being shown an online advertisement also makes a reservation; to track conversion with partner websites and to analyse the traffic patterns of users to optimise the services we bring to you.
