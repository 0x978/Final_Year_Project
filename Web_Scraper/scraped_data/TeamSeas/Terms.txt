Terms of Use: last updated October 27, 2021 FAQ Contact Us Press Inquiries JOIN #TEAMSEAS Every $1 is one less pound of trash in the ocean January 1, 2022 at 11:59pm PT Every single dollar #TeamSeas raises toward the $30M will go to independently verified pounds of trash that have been removed from beaches, rivers or the ocean. When you donate, the funds go directly to the two not-for-profit organizations, Ocean Conservancy and The Ocean Cleanup. They split the funds 50/50 and the money will be released when the trash is removed and verified: $1, one pound. Each non-profit is responsible for delivering on their half of the goal. Great question! Wherever and whenever possible, items like cans, glass, and plastic beverage bottles will be separated and recycled. In cases where contamination of the trash and/or lack of local recycling makes it impossible to reprocess, trash will go to a proper disposal site in accordance with local regulations and capacity. That’s why we need to reduce the amount of plastic we use and waste we generate, period. The ocean and the life within it are incredibly important. Aside from the water we drink, the ocean produces half the air we breathe every day. So it’s a no-brainer that keeping it clean and healthy is critical to our survival. Unfortunately our ocean—and the rivers that feed it—are full of plastic trash. It’s estimated that there are 200M tons of plastic already circulating in marine environments, with an estimated 11M tons entering the ocean EVERY YEAR. Pollution from items like bottles, bags, straws and abandoned fishing gear is a health crisis for our entire planet. We’re glad you asked. Because 30M pounds is A LOT of trash (roughly equivalent to 85 football fields covered a foot deep). We’re dividing our work among three points of intervention: beaches, rivers and oceans. BeachesWith the experts at Ocean Conservancy, we’ll send professional crews to clean up some of the most iconic, vulnerable beaches on the planet. We’ll also be holding safe, locally-hosted #TeamSeas events leveraging Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) network so #TeamSeas supporters can roll up their sleeves and make an impact firsthand, one pound of trash at a time. The ICC is the largest beach cleanup network in the world (more than 350 million pounds of trash have been collected from beaches in its 35+ year history!) Beaches RiversFor our rivers, #TeamSeas will fund Interceptors™, The Ocean Cleanup’s river cleanup technologies that collect trash before it can reach the ocean. The Ocean Cleanup has several Interceptors already deployed in some of the world’s most polluted rivers to catch plastic and trash upstream. #TeamSeas will support the expansion and continued operation of this work as The Ocean Cleanup takes aim at the 1% of rivers which contribute 80% of the trash flowing into the ocean from rivers. Rivers OceansLost, abandoned and discarded fishing gear – or ghost gear – is some of the deadliest ocean trash, and is super tricky to recover. #TeamSeas will work with Ocean Conservancy’s Global Ghost Gear Initiative® to go to ghost gear “graveyards,” where we’ll identify and float the abandoned gear to the surface, hook it onto boat cranes and remove it from the ocean forever. Oceans We want you to do what you do best. Talk to a friend, organize your school or business, make some art, film a video, whatever makes sense to you and your community as we work toward 30M. For #TeamTrees, we saw artists draw comics for trees, kids hold bakesales, and tech founders one-up each other on the Leaderboard. Whoever your team is, get them on #TeamSeas. You can create a Team during checkout or join one from Search. We recommend you start by telling someone else about the mission, why you’re passionate about it, and invite them to get involved at TeamSeas.org. We also encourage you to engage with and amplify #TeamSeas content across the internet. We think you’ll be surprised at who else is on #TeamSeas and how many fascinating videos are out there for you to discover. As the campaign develops, we hope you’ll co-create it with us as we rally toward our shared 30M goal. One of the most exciting parts for us is that we have no idea what you’ll come up with, and we can’t wait to see it. #TeamSeas official social accounts will always be listed here and on the homepage. If you’re not sure if it’s legit, check TeamSeas.org. Here’s the latest list: Last but not least, we encourage you to engage with other #TeamSeas supporters to weave together all our crazy internet worlds in support of the cause. Spread love, mash the RT button, and if you see a way to organize something cool together, well, that’s awesome! The plastic pollution problem is so big that no single solution will fix it at once. But we’ve got to start somewhere. 30M pounds of trash collected is 30M pounds of trash that won’t come face to face with whales, dolphins, seabirds and other beloved wildlife, and that won’t keep breaking down into smaller and smaller pieces, ending up on our dinner plates. There are a lot of ways you can tackle the problem, and we think cleanups are complementary so long as they’re not excuses for delay. By reaching a billion people through #TeamSeas videos, and activating new generations of ocean advocates, we hope to inspire a movement and demand for solutions. Plastic and our oceans don’t mix, and we’re here to do something about it.
