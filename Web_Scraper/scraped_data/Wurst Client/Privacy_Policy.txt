There is no Google Analytics on this website, it's only in the Wurst Client itself. When you launch Wurst, it only sends a single message to the Google Analytics server saying which Wurst version and Minecraft version was just launched. It doesn't track what you do with Wurst or how long you use it for.

I have also disabled the following Google AdSense options worldwide: disabled
