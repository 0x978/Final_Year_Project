California residents must, as a condition of this Agreement, waive the applicability of California Civil Code Section 1542 for unknown claims which states: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY." You waive this section of the California Civil Code and any similar provision in law, regulation or code that has the same effect or intent as the foregoing release. Indiegogo is based in San Francisco, California. For any action not subject to arbitration, you and Indiegogo agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in San Francisco, CA or the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The Terms and the relationship between you and Indiegogo shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT. You and Indiegogo agree that this arbitration undertaking is made pursuant to or in connection with a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act at 9 U.S.C. Section 1, et seq. Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us, including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to interactions between users); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this Section are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below. By agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve any and all disputes with Indiegogo as follows: Arbitration Procedures : If the Dispute has not been resolved and is not subject to the exclusions provided above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve all Disputes, subject to the terms set forth below. To start an arbitration with JAMS, you must do the following: (1) write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (2) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, 2 Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco, CA 94111; and (3) send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration to Indiegogo at Corporation Service Company, 2710 Gateway Oaks Drive, Suite 150N, Sacramento, California 95833-3502, ATTN: Indiegogo, Inc. - Arbitration Demand. You will be required to pay $250 to initiate an arbitration against us. If the arbitrator finds the arbitration to be non-frivolous, Indiegogo will pay all other fees invoiced by JAMS, including filing fees and arbitrator and hearing expenses. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise. Location of Arbitration: If you live in the United States, you may initiate and litigate the arbitration in your hometown area or through the JAMS office located in San Francisco, California. If you live outside the United States, you must initiate and litigate the arbitration through the JAMS office located in San Francisco, California. Either party may ask that the arbitration including the hearings, arguments, and all conferences be conducted telephonically or by video conference (e.g., Skype). The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, Additional Policies, or the Privacy Policy, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms, Additional Policies, or Privacy Policy is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. CLASS ACTION WAIVER: The parties agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND INDIEGOGO AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A LEAD OR REPRESENTATIVE CLASS PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. HOWEVER, THE PARTIES EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED, UPON REQUEST BY EITHER PARTY, IF SUCH SEPARATE INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATIONS RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S). CONSOLIDATION MEANS THAT ANY AND ALL SEPARATELY INITIATED ARBITRATIONS THAT RELATE TO OR ARISE OUT OF THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TRANSACTION(S) OR OCCURRENCE(S) ARE ALL HEARD BY A SINGLE ARBITRATOR IN A SINGLE ARBITRATION. IF EITHER PARTY REQUESTS CONSOLIDATION OF MULTIPLE ARBITRATIONS, THEN THE PARTIES TO THE CONSOLIDATED CASE(S) WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE WAIVED THEIR RIGHT TO DESIGNATE AN ARBITRATOR AS WELL AS ANY CONTRACTUAL PROVISION WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE OF THE ARBITRATION. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS MAY BE CONSIDERED IN REQUESTING A CONSOLIDATION OF ARBITRATIONS: By agreeing to these Terms, you are waiving your right to trial by jury or to participate in a class action. We are also waiving these rights. Exclusions from Arbitration: Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims: Notwithstanding the parties' agreement to resolve Disputes through arbitration, either party may (1) bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to misuse, infringement, or misappropriation of intellectual property theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights ("intellectual property rights" means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights); and/or (2) seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court's jurisdiction. Severability: If a court or arbitrator decides that any portion of this Section regarding Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver is invalid or unenforceable, then the portion shall be severed from the Terms and/or deemed modified, only to the extent necessary to make it lawful. Such invalidity shall not affect the enforceability of any other provisions of the Terms that are not invalid or unenforceable. To affect the modification of the portion, the portion shall be deemed deleted, added to, and/or rewritten, whichever shall most fully preserve the intentions of the parties as originally expressed herein. The Terms and the relationship between you and Indiegogo shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. This “Dispute Resolution, Arbitration and Class Action Waiver” section shall survive any termination of your account, these Terms, or the Services. These Terms are the entire agreement between You and Indiegogo with respect to the Services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Indiegogo with respect to the Services and govern our relationship. If any provision of these Terms are deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. Indiegogo's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. We may modify or discontinue the Services at any time, in our sole discretion. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Indiegogo’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim arising out of or related to the Services must commence within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently barred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this statute of limitations shall not apply to residents of New Jersey.
