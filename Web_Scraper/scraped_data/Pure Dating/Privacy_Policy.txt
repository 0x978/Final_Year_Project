If you access a link to a network while logged into your user account on the network in question, the content of PURE may be linked to your user account on the network, i.e., the network may link your visit originating from PURE directly to your user account on the social network.

In any case, an association takes place when you log in to the relevant network after clicking on the link.

We may transfer your Personal Data abroad to third parties that may be located in any country in the world (in particular in other countries in Europe, Hong Kong, and the USA). These countries may have different laws about data processing and, as the case may be, data protection laws that have been deemed inadequate by competent authorities to protect your privacy rights.

The data recipients are obliged to protect your Personal Data in accordance with the agreed contractual obligations and the applicable data protection laws. If the level of data protection in a country does not correspond to the Swiss or European level, we will contractually ensure that the protection of your Personal Data always corresponds to the level in Switzerland or the EU. For this purpose, we agree with the third parties on the EU standard clauses and, if necessary, implement additional technical and organizational measures.

In particular, we may disclose your Personal Data to the following categories of recipients:

Service providers: We work with trusted service providers that process your Personal Data on our behalf or under joint responsibility (e.g., providers of telecommunications systems, email, database, hosting, outsourcing, payment, user verification, advertising, marketing, analytics, anti-spam, anti-fraud services). These service providers may also use your Personal Data for their own purposes. Service providers provide information about their independent data processing in their own privacy statements.
Buyers or merger partners: In connection with an actual or potential restructuring of part or all of our business or our assets or any rights or interests therein, we may disclose your Personal Data to potential buyers or merger partners or sellers and their advisors.

9. How do we secure your Personal Data?
We use appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, or alteration. Our employees and the service providers commissioned by us are contractually obliged to maintain confidentiality and to comply with the provisions of data protection law.

However, it is not possible for us to guarantee the absolute security of Personal Data. In this context, please note that data transmitted over an open network such as the Internet or an email service is openly accessible. We cannot guarantee the confidentiality of messages or content shared over these networks. Thus, Personal Data sent to us via open networks will not be subject to the same security measures as Personal Data contained within PURE.

10. Your rights

Access: You have the right to access your Personal Data. This gives you the opportunity to check what Personal Data we process about you and that we process it in accordance with the applicable data protection regulations.
