BOOKING WITH THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIERS THROUGH Tripadvisor Use of Tripadvisor Booking Services. The Tripadvisor Companies offer you the ability to search for, select, and book travel reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already. AS A USER OF THE SERVICES, INCLUDING Tripadvisor COMPANIES’ BOOKING FACILITATION SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT: (1) THE Tripadvisor COMPANIES WILL NOT HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO YOU OR OTHERS FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS MADE USING YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT; AND (2) THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO Tripadvisor, ITS CORPORATE AFFILIATES AND/OR OTHERS. The Tripadvisor Companies will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily, but reserve the right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Tripadvisor Companies also reserve the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request. In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order but becomes unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation. Third-Party Suppliers. The Tripadvisor Companies are not travel agencies and do not provide or own transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences. Although the Tripadvisor Companies display information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitate reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites, such actions do not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute the Tripadvisor Companies’ sponsorship or approval of third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Tripadvisor Companies and third-party suppliers. Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities or experiences based on their own experiences, the Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse or recommend the products or services of any third-party suppliers, save that Tripadvisor does issue certain businesses awards that are based on the reviews posted by Account Holders. The Tripadvisor Companies do not endorse any Content posted, submitted or otherwise provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein, and the Tripadvisor Companies expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with such Content. You agree that the Tripadvisor Companies are not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services. If you book a reservation with a third-party supplier, then in addition to this Agreement, you agree to review and be bound by the supplier’s terms and conditions of purchase and website use, privacy policy, and any other rules or policies related to the supplier’s site or property. Your interactions with third-party suppliers are at your own risk. The Tripadvisor Companies will have no liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or negligence of any third-party suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage, or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with third-party suppliers. The Services may link you to supplier sites or other sites that Tripadvisor does not operate or control. For further information, please refer to the “Links to Third-Party Sites” section below. Booking Vacation Rentals, Restaurant Reservations and Experiences with Third-Party Suppliers Listed on Corporate Affiliate Sites. Some of Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates act as marketplaces to facilitate travelers’ ability to (1) enter into vacation rental agreements with property owners and managers (“Vacation Rentals”), (2) make reservations for restaurants (“Restaurants”) and/or (3) make reservations for tours, activities and attractions (variously, “Experiences”) with third-party suppliers of such Experiences (each such supplier of a vacation rental and/or Experience to be referred to as an “Advertiser”). Those corporate affiliates of Tripadvisor syndicate their advertisements to other entities within the Tripadvisor Companies group and that is why you see them on the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites. As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular, the Tripadvisor Companies’ websites), and any transaction involving Vacation Rentals, Restaurants or Experiences facilitated by Tripadvisor’s corporate affiliates. We do not own, manage, or contract for any Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience listed on the Services. Because neither Tripadvisor nor its corporate affiliates are parties to Vacation Rental transactions, Restaurant reservations or Experience-related transactions between travelers and Advertisers, any dispute or conflict involving an actual or potential transaction between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a listed Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the Advertiser’s ability to rent a Vacation Rental property, provide you with a reservation, meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a Vacation Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the responsibility of each user. One of Tripadvisor’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an Advertiser, or a Tripadvisor corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Vacation Rental reservation or Experience. TRAVEL DESTINATIONS International Travel. When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including passports and visas, are in order. For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for up-to-date information before booking and departure. The Tripadvisor Companies accept no liability for travelers who are refused entry onto a flight or into any country because of the traveler’s failure to carry the travel documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries the traveler may just be passing through en route to his or her destination. It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on inoculations before you travel internationally, and to ensure that you meet all health entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.

In some cases, you may be asked by a third party site or app to link your Tripadvisor account profile to a profile on another third party site. You are responsible for deciding if you choose to do so, it is purely optional, and the decision to allow this information to be linked can be disabled (with the third party site or app) at any time. If you do choose to link your Tripadvisor account to a third party site or app, the third party site or app will be able to access the information you have stored on your Tripadvisor account, including information regarding other users with whom you share information.
