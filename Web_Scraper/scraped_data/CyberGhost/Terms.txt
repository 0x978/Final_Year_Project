Consumers shall have the right to revoke this contract within fourteen (14) days without stating a reason. 13.1.2. In the case of a contract for Services or a contract for the delivery of individually acquired or recurring digital content not installed on a physical data carrier, the revocation period shall be fourteen days from the date the contract was concluded. In the case of a purchase contract for the delivery of goods (e.g. back-up CDs), the revocation period shall be fourteen days from the date on which the Consumer – or a third party designated by the Consumer who is not a freight carrier – takes possession of the goods. 13.1.3.According to applicable law, the right of revocation does not arise or exist ➢ with respect to contracts for the delivery of goods if they are not ready-made but were manufactured in accordance with an individual choice or determination of the Consumer or are clearly tailored to the personal needs of the Consumer, and ➢with respect to contracts for the delivery of audio and video recordings or computer software in a sealed package if the seal was broken after delivery. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CLAUSE 13 SHALL ONLY APPLY TO CONSUMERS WHO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT FOR THE DELIVERY OF DIGITAL CONTENT NOT INSTALLED ON A PHYSICAL DATA CARRIER. THE CONSUMER: 1) EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE EXECUTION OF THIS CONTRACT SHALL COMMENCE BEFORE THE EXPIRATION OF THE REVOCATION PERIOD, AND 2) IS AWARE THAT HE WILL LOSE HIS RIGHT OF REVOCATION WHEN THE EXECUTION OF THIS CONTRACT COMMENCES. Any money-back-guarantee or other guarantee or warranty of similar content granted by cleverbridge as regulated in Clause 14 shall not be affected by this Clause. To meet the revocation deadline, it is sufficient for the Consumer to send notice that he is exercising his right of revocation prior to the expiration of the revocation period. 13.4.1 If the Consumer revokes this contract, cleverbridge or Crossrider Sports must promptly refund all of the payments cleverbridge or Crossrider Sports received from the Consumer, including delivery costs, no later than fourteen days from the date on which the notice of revocation of the contract was received by cleverbridge or Crossrider Sports (with the exception of additional costs incurred because the Consumer has chosen a different mode of delivery than the most cost-effective one, i.e. the standard mode of delivery offered by cleverbridge or Crossrider Sports). For this refund, cleverbridge or Crossrider Sports shall use the same means of payment that was used by the Consumer in the original transaction, unless otherwise expressly agreed with the Consumer. In no case shall the Consumer be charged a fee for the refund. 13.4.2 In the case of a contract for Services, the following shall apply: If the Consumer requested that the Services commence during the revocation period, the Consumer shall pay cleverbridge/Crossrider Sports a reasonable amount, which corresponds to the percentage of Services provided by the time the Consumer informs cleverbridge/Crossrider Sports of the exercise of his right to revoke the contract, as compared to the total scope of the Services contemplated by the contract. 13.4.3 If there is a purchase contract for the delivery of goods, the following shall apply: cleverbridge/Crossrider Sports can refuse to make a refund until it has received the goods back or until the Consumer proves that he has sent the goods back, whichever is earlier. The Consumer shall promptly return or send the goods to cleverbridge/Crossrider Sports no later than fourteen days from the date on which the Consumer informed cleverbridge/Crossrider Sports of the revocation of the contract. The deadline is met if the Consumer sends the goods before the expiration of the fourteen-day period. The Consumer shall bear the direct costs of returning the goods.
