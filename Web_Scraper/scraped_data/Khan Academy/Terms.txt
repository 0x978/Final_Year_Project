If a User chooses to associate a personal account with their School Account, the two accounts will be deemed "Linked" Accounts, and the User's learning activity (information regarding use of the Website generated by the User through use of the Website), whether generated during or outside of the school use, may be viewed by any person with access to either account. “Linked" Accounts are not separately functioning accounts; they permit access to a singular Khan Academy account using more than one account interface or set of access credentials. Linked Accounts may benefit Students who want to use the Website for both personal and school purposes, by allowing School Personnel to have a deeper understanding of Student progress, and by allowing Users to keep track of all of their Khan Academy learning activity on an aggregate basis. The User's election to enable account linking must be made, if at all, in connection with the initial account registration and rostering process for a given school year. Once accounts are linked, they cannot be separated. Khan Academy may (but is not required to) enable linking of accounts as described herein. Upon any termination of the School Account by authorized School Personnel, the User's learning activity (including any learning activity from school use) will be retained in any Linked personal account.

We strongly encourage that you require your authorized Users to review such guidelines (as well as any accompanying educational material related to our chatbot) as a prerequisite to access to our chatbot. For instance, Users should be aware that our chatbot may make mistakes and the User needs to fact check the response provided (referred to as Output). You have the obligation to monitor and approve the use of the Services, and we strongly recommend adult supervision for your authorized Users. When using the Services, you will be subject to any additional posted guidelines or rules applicable to specific services and features which may be posted from time to time (the “Guidelines”).

For any material changes to the Terms, Khan Academy will make reasonable effort to provide notice to you of such amended Terms, such as by an email notification to the address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Services, and such amended terms will be effective against you on the earlier of (i) your actual notice of such changes and (ii) thirty days after Khan Academy makes reasonable attempt to provide you such notice. However, changes addressing new functions for a service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified Terms, you must discontinue your use of the Services. Disputes arising under these Terms will be resolved in accordance with the version of the Terms in place at the time the dispute arose. The following provisions apply to School Accounts in addition to the provisions set forth in Section 4.1 (General) above. If a change with respect to how personal information contained in education records is used or shared has a material adverse impact on Student Users or an Institution, and the Institution does not agree to the change, the Institution must notify Khan Academy within thirty days of receiving the notice of change as described under Section 15.1 (Notice) below. If Khan Academy is notified as required, then the School Accounts held by that Institution will remain governed by the Terms in effect immediately prior to the change until the end of the end of the then current term of the Institution's written service agreement with Khan Academy, or, in the absence of such an agreement, the end of the current school term. If the Services are renewed or continued after such time, they will be renewed or continued under Khan Academy's then-current Terms.

For clarity, AI Content is User Content. You acknowledge that due to the nature of machine learning and the technology powering our chatbot, your Output may not be unique and the same or similar Output may be provided to other users. You are responsible for the AI Content that you and your authorized Users generate, including for ensuring that you have rights to submit the Input and that your use of Input does not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or violate any applicable law or these Terms. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, creating, or publishing such User Content. AI Content is intended for personal use and not to generate content for broad-based publication. It is your responsibility to review Output and double check Output with reputable sources prior to sharing.

Khan Academy grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Licensed Educational Content as made available on the Services by Khan Academy solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. Unless expressly indicated on the Services that a particular item of Licensed Educational Content is made available to Users under alternate license terms, you may not download, distribute, sell, lease, modify, or otherwise provide access to the Licensed Educational Content to any third party. 7.2.1. Alternate Licenses. In certain cases, Khan Academy or its licensors may make available Licensed Educational Content under alternate license terms, such as a variant of the Creative Commons License (as defined below) (each, an “Alternate License”). Where expressly indicated as such on the Services, and subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the applicable Licensed Educational Content is licensed to you under the terms of the Alternate License. By using, downloading, or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Content, you agree to comply fully with all the terms and conditions of such Alternate License.

Unless otherwise indicated, all Licensed Educational Code is the property of Khan Academy or third-party licensors and, subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, is licensed to you under the terms of the MIT License. By downloading or otherwise accessing such Licensed Educational Code, you agree to comply with all the terms of the MIT License. The Licensed Educational Content and Licensed Educational Code are intended for personal, non-commercial use only. Without limiting the foregoing, and notwithstanding the terms of any Alternate License for such Licensed Educational Content, the Licensed Educational Content may not be used, distributed or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose, commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, unless otherwise previously agreed in writing by Khan Academy. 7.4.1. Impermissible Uses. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following are types of uses that Khan Academy expressly defines as falling outside of “non-commercial” use:7.4.1.1. the sale or rental of (1) any part of the Licensed Educational Content, (2) any derivative works based at least in part on the Licensed Educational Content, or (3) any collective work that includes any part of the Licensed Educational Content;7.4.1.2. providing training, support, or editorial services that use or reference the Licensed Educational Content in exchange for a fee; and7.4.1.3. the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions placed on the Licensed Educational Content, or any part thereof, or the sale of advertisements, sponsorships, or promotions on any website or blog containing any part of the Licensed Educational Material, including without limitation any “pop-up advertisements”.7.4.2. Use Characterization. Whether a particular use of the Licensed Educational Content is “non-commercial” depends on the use, not the user.

As an example, a for-profit corporation’s use of the Licensed Educational Content for internal professional development or training of employees is permitted, so long as the corporation charges no fees, directly or indirectly, for such use. Conversely, as another example, a non-profit entity’s use of the Licensed Educational Content in connection with an fee-based training or educational program is NOT “non-commercial” and is not permitted. 7.4.1.

Any waiver of any provision of the Terms will be effective only if in writing and signed by Khan Academy. The Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. BY AGREEING TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE. 15.4.1. Generally. In order to expedite and control the cost of disputes, Khan Academy and you agree that any legal or equitable claim, dispute, action or proceeding arising from or related to your use of the Services or these Terms (“Dispute”) will be resolved as follows to the fullest extent permitted by law: 15.4.3. Binding Arbitration. Any Dispute which has not been resolved by negotiation as provided herein within sixty (60) days or such time period as you and Khan Academy may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 15.4 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration). You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. The place of arbitration shall be Santa Clara County, California. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award. 15.4.4. Class Action Waiver. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor Khan Academy will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. You may file a Dispute only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Users. If there is a final judicial determination that any particular Dispute cannot be arbitrated in accordance with the limitations of this Section 15.4 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration), then only that Dispute may be severed and brought in court. All other Disputes remain subject to this Section 15.4 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration). 15.4.5. Arbitration Procedures. Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”) in effect at the time the Dispute is filed. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, Khan Academy and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief to you only individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim. 15.4.6. Arbitration Fees. Whoever files the arbitration will pay the initial filing fee. If Khan Academy files, then Khan Academy will pay; if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules. Each party will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. 15.4.7. Filing Period. To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under these Terms must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins when the events giving rise to the Dispute first occur. If a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred. 15.4.8. Venue. In the event that any Dispute cannot be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with this Section 15.4 (Dispute Resolution and Arbitration), you agree that such Dispute will be filed only in the state or federal courts in and for Santa Clara County, California, and each of you and Khan Academy hereby consent and submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such action. Notwithstanding this, Khan Academy shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive or other equitable relief to protect or enforce its intellectual property rights in any court of competent jurisdiction. If any provision of the Terms or any Guidelines is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from the Terms to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. The Terms and related Guidelines, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without Khan Academy’s prior written consent, but may be assigned by Khan Academy without consent or any restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of the Terms shall be null and void.
