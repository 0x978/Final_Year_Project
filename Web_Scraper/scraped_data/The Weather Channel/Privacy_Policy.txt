We assign an owner to each of our Services processing personal information, who is responsible for processing activities throughout the product and processing lifecycle. The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services. Web/Mobile Web Use of Location Information Apps Use of Location Information Data Vendor Use of Location Information We and third parties acting on our behalf, or on behalf of advertisers or vendors, use various technologies that help us to manage the operations of our Services and track usage behavior. These technologies enable us to personalize your experience, advertisements, and provide you with requested forecast data. We follow the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA"), the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada ("DAAC"), and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance ("EDAA"). Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and our vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services. Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Information Saved by Other Technologies Third parties may use cookies and other technologies through use of our Services to support or deliver personalized advertising on third-party websites and online services. The data collection technologies we and third parties use on web include but are not limited to: Category 1: Strictly Necessary Cookies These cookies are essential in order to enable you to use the Services and its features. Category 2: Performance Cookies These cookies collect information about how you use the Services (such as which pages you go to most often and if you receive error messages). In general, these cookies do not collect information that directly identifies you. However, some such cookies may collect GeoIP or other identifiers that may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions. Category 3: Functionality Cookies These cookies allow Services to remember choices you make (such as language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced features (such as local weather reports or traffic news). These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to customize the Services. Category 4: Targeting Cookies These cookies collect several pieces of information about your browsing habits. They are often placed by advertising networks rather than website operators. They collect information about your interactions over time with the Services as well as with third-party websites and online services. This information may be shared with other organizations such as advertisers in order to provide you with advertisements that may be more relevant to you based on your inferred interests. Category 5: Social Network Cookies These cookies are generally generated by content embeds. They allow social network users to share content and use other features such as publishing comments. Web beacons: Certain pages on the Services contain web beacons, also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that accessed the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party. Web Storage: We use local storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device. Use of Advertising Identifiers Your Choices Around Cookies, Advertising Identifiers, and Other Technologies Used by Vendors You have the ability to control how your data is used, including for personalized advertising, in the following ways: Device settings: The Android and iOS mobile device operating systems allow you to control how your device’s advertising identifier is used to support or deliver personalized advertising. The iOS versions 14 and above mobile device operating systems allow you to control use of the advertising identifier and “tracking;” learn about tracking from Apple at Settings > Privacy > Tracking > Learn More The opt outs described above are device- or browser-specific and may not be available for all devices. If you opt out on your mobile device, you may continue to receive personalized advertising on your desktop computer or other devices. If you choose to opt out, you will still see ads, but the ads will not be based on your activities across other apps and websites you use. You can also opt out of future information collection from the Services by adjusting the settings on your device, ceasing use of the Service on web, or un-installing the relevant App. Industry Group Opt-Outs: Some industry organizations offer centralized tools where you can opt out of the use of your data by multiple vendors at once. For more information about Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out tools to assist you in managing choices for participating companies that use cookies, visit the following websites: Information collected via the data collection technologies described in this section may be linked to other information about you such as location information and may be considered personal data. We and vendors may use the technologies described in this section, alone or in combination, to understand user behavior, target and measure the effectiveness of advertisements, help diagnose problems, recognize repeat visitors, and facilitate your access to and use of the Services. Do Not Track: Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals, and in general the signal has yet to gain widespread acceptance. As a result, we will not recognize requests coming through as DNT signals. Marketing and Newsletter Communications: If you have previously subscribed to any of our marketing or newsletter communications with your email address, you have three options to opt-out of this correspondence as detailed below: We may also share any information collected from the Services including aggregated or statistical data that we may generate from such information in the following ways: Companies Offering Promotions, Products, or Services At times, we will provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive promotions, products, or services from third-party sponsors. We also may provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you choose to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with them to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by their privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them. Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins and Links Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad. In that case, the URL or prominent text on the other website will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by this Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personal data. Some of the Services allow users to interact with other websites or services. You may remain logged into those other sites and services until you log off. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Policy. Some of the Services use third-party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone, and tablet devices), and some of the Services are provided by third-party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services. We do not control these third-party entities, products, and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit, and disclose your information. As we do not control these third-parties' data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use, and license agreements (if any). Bundling Companions We have partnered with several publishers and businesses to provide you with an option to bundle (“the Bundle”) their subscriptions through your registered account and/or on an offer page available on our Services. You will need to manage your account for the Bundle on our Services. By subscribing to the Bundle, you agree that certain account information (e.g., your e-mail address, name, and account status) will be provided to each Bundling Companion for purposes of assessing your eligibility for the Bundle, activating, administering, improving your experience with the Bundle and each Bundling Companion, and communicating confirmation that the Bundle has been activated. Any such account information received by the Bundling Companion will be subject to each Bundling Companion’s respective Policy and Terms of Use. Purchase or Sale of Businesses We continually look for ways to improve our business, including purchasing a business or selling all or part of our business. If we buy, merge, reorganize or sell any business or assets, personal data and non-personal information will likely be disclosed or transferred as part of the transaction. Personal Weather Station and Air Quality Data You may choose to contribute to the Weather Underground community and our Services by connecting your Personal Weather Station (PWS) and/or air quality sensor. If so, we will use this data in the Services, including to provide air quality and sensor data in our Services. You grant this consent during the registration process for your PWS or sensor. We will retain your information for as long as needed to provide and develop the Services. We will also retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We may retain information that no longer identifies you indefinitely. You can request to access, obtain a portable copy of, correct, or delete data related to your stored preferences and your use of the Services. Please note that we may take steps to verify your identity to enable us to respond to your request. Because we do not require users to register to use our Services, if you use more than one of our Services, or if you use our Services on more than one device or web browser, you may need to manage your data for each of the Services separately. However, if you have a registered account and are logged in to your account at the time of the request, we will be able to retrieve data related to your use of the Services while you were logged in and all other devices you have used while logged into your registered account. Please note that following a deletion request, we will resume collecting personal data if you continue your use of the Services, and your personal data will also enable us to personalize the Services you visit and the ads that are placed on the Services. As permitted by law or to provide our Services, we do not delete data we use to: The Services are hosted on servers inside and outside the United States. If you are located in the European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, information that we collect (including through cookies) will be processed and stored in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the data protection and privacy laws may not offer the same level of protection as those in the country where you reside or are a citizen. Subject to applicable law, by using our Services and providing information to us, you consent to the transfer to and processing of information in the United States and other jurisdictions. Where necessary under applicable law, we may employ appropriate cross-border transfer methods governing personal data. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures intended to protect your data. Of course, we cannot guarantee that your communications with the Services will never be unlawfully intercepted or that your data will never be unlawfully accessed by third parties. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. We reserve the right to change this Policy as business needs require. If we decide to change this Policy, we will post those changes here prior to the time they take effect. If we make material changes to the way we use personal data, we will notify affected users through the Services.

You can opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information at any time in the following ways.

If you do not have an account or are using the Services without logging into your account, you will have to opt out from each browser or device where you access the Services. Please note that if you are traveling outside of California within the U.S., you may see the option to “Opt Out of Targeted Advertising and the Sale of My Personal Data” displayed instead of “Do Not Sell or Share My personal information.” While we use different wording outside of California within the U.S., functionalities remain the same so opting out of targeted advertising and the sale of personal data will also opt you out of sale or sharing of personal information. Web Mobile App We recognize and honor Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) on the Sites when you are located in the U.S. When GPC is enabled on a supported browser, we will treat it as an opt-out of the sale or sharing of personal information preference signal. The GPC signal will apply to your browser and will take precedence over any previously provided consent choice on the Sites or our Services. If you have a registered account, the GPC enabled signal will be associated to your account as an “opted-out” selection and will follow you across devices when logged in to your account. Users with an ad-free subscription will automatically be opted out of the sale or sharing of personal information. The Storm Radar mobile app, the Weather Underground mobile app and The Weather Channel in-vehicle app do not process precise geolocation data to create such audience segments based on your preferences and characteristics. Therefore, the right to limit the use of Sensitive personal information is not offered to Storm Radar mobile app users or The Weather Channel in-vehicle app users. The Weather Underground services, Storm Radar mobile app, and The Weather Channel in-vehicle app do not process precise geolocation data to create audience segments based on your preferences and characteristics, therefore, the right to limit the use of Sensitive personal information is not offered for these Services.

Please note that state laws vary, and additional states are actively passing consumer data privacy laws, and we will continue to update our disclosures, processes and this notice as the laws and rules are finalized. Please note that if you are traveling within the U.S., you may see different combinations for options to “Opt Out of Targeted Advertising and the Sale of My Personal Data” and “Do Not Sell or Share My personal information.” While we use different wording in certain states within the U.S., functionalities remain the same so opting out of targeted advertising will also opt you out of the sale or sharing of personal information.

Processing Basis: Our processing of your personal data in order to provide you with the Services will typically be based on one of the following processing bases: (i) because you have provided us with your specific, informed, freely-given, and unambiguous consent, (ii) because we need to process it in order to provide you with the Services or a particular feature of the Services; that is, because we cannot readily fulfil your request without performing the relevant processing, or (iii) because the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued either by us or by a third party and such legitimate interests are not overridden by your privacy and related rights as an individual.

We may also use the collected location information to show you content (including advertisements) that are relevant to your geographic location. The type of location information we collect depends on your settings in the device you use to access the Services. Alerts and Notifications. Certain Services offer you the ability to receive push notifications (or in-vehicle app notifications) for weather-related or product updates, news stories, and special offers. To provide these Services, we may need to collect your device/browser information and/or mobile carrier information, in addition to the postcode or geographic area to which the alert, update, or notification pertains, including location information shared with the in-vehicle application (either precise location or contextual/searched location). If you no longer wish to receive these types of notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the settings of your device/browser, in-vehicle application, or the particular Service for which you registered, or by deleting the application.

At times, we will provide you with the opportunity to choose to receive promotions, products, or services from third-party sponsors. We also may provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically identified third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer.

We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by their privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them. Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins and Links. Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer or an interactive ad. In that case, the URL or prominent text on the other website will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-email opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by this Privacy Policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices.

Any such account information received by the Bundling Companion will be subject to each Bundling Companion’s respective Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. Purchase or Sale of Businesses. We continually look for ways to improve our business, including purchasing a business or selling all or part of our business.
