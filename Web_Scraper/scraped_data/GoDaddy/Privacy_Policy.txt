For transfers of PII from the European Union/European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, we have certified our compliance with the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework (“EU-U.S. DPF), the Swiss-U.S. Data Privacy Framework, and the UK Extension to the EU-U.S. DPF, collectively (the “DPF”). Please see our Data Privacy Framework Notice for more information on our participation in the DPF Program. Please see our European Data Protection Disclosures for more information pursuant to the DPF and other transfer mechanisms we use to transfer PII from the EU/EEA, Switzerland, and the UK. Length of Retention We retain PII for our business needs and to comply with law. If we no longer need PII, we may delete it or de-identify it so that it no longer identifies a specific person. Factors we consider when deciding when to delete or de-identify your PII include: (1) if you still have an account, (2) if we are required to retain PII to comply with law, or (3) if the PII is needed for tax other business purposes. Security We use risk-based measures to protect PII, including appropriate security controls and employee training. We also require that our service providers, business partners, and advertisers use appropriate risk-based controls to protect PII. No Collection of PII about Children We do not knowingly collect PII about anyone under 18 without permission from their legal guardian. Please contact us at privacy@godaddy.com if you believe we have collected information from a child without permission from their legal guardian. Legal Basis for Processing We process PII upon your request, with your consent, to fulfill our contract with you, based on our legitimate interest, or other lawful bases. The specific basis of processing depends on the services you are using, the data being processed, the place where the processing occurs, and the place where you live. If you have questions about our basis for processing your PII, please contact us at privacy@godaddy.com. Non-Discrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. No Financial Incentives We do not provide any financial incentives for providing PII to us. Policy Changes We may revise this Global Privacy Notice by posting a revised statement at the same location as this Notice or on another location on our website. If we change this Notice, it will apply to personal data collected prior to adoption of the new statement only to the extent as the new statement does not reduce the rights of affected data subjects.
