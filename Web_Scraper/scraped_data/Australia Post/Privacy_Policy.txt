The way we do this may vary depending on the information, product, service, or event that the child wishes to participate in. Consent may take a variety of forms such as printing and submitting a permission form by mail, or online consent such as by ticking an online check box that parental or guardian consent has been obtained. Parents or guardians may, subject to any applicable laws, request that information collected from their child be deleted.
