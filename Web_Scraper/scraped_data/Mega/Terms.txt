You should keep your password and recovery key safe and confidential. You must not share your password with anyone and should not release encryption keys to anyone unless you want them to have access to your Data. . Encryption won’t help if someone has full access to your password or device. We strongly urge you to use best practices for ensuring the safety and security of your system and devices (e.g. via unique passwords, security upgrades, firewall protection, anti-virus software, securing and encrypting your devices). MEGA will never send you emails asking for your password so do not be fooled. Any such email will not be from us.

In that case, you and any other user with the right to access that file will have access to the original file which will be retained as long as any user has a right to access it under these Terms.

By filing a counter-notice, you accept the above terms. If you do not accept the above terms, do not file a counter-notice.

Counter-notices must be submitted using the email address associated with that MEGA account. If we do not receive any further communication from or on behalf of the person who originally submitted the takedown notice, or any communication we do receive does not in our sole opinion adequately justify the original takedown notice, we may, but are not obliged to, reinstate the material in approximately 10 to 14 days provided we have no reason to believe that the material infringes copyright. Nothing in clauses prejudices our right to remove or disable access to any material at any time, for any reason or no reason.
