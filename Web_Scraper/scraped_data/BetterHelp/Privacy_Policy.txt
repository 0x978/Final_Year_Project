Sensitive personal information that we Process includes your racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, and data concerning your health or about your sex life or sexual orientation. When you begin to use our services and register your account, we ask you to provide answers to a questionnaire to customize the service, to match you with a Therapist, and to provide therapy and related services to you. In providing your responses to the questionnaire you may provide us with “sensitive personal Information” as described above. You may also continue to share such data with us as you receive services. This data is necessary as it allows us to continue providing services to you and customize our services for you. It is also necessary to provide healthcare with a personalized and well-selected Therapist based on points of data which impact your therapy and health care needs. The Therapist also reviews this data and can choose to not work with you if they are not a good fit. We may also use this information to improve our service and understand how you interact with the services. How we obtain your personal information BetterHelp obtains the categories of personal information listed above from the following sources: Directly from you, such as information when you apply to be a counselor or that you submit during the Process of using and paying for our Services. Indirectly from you, such as through your actions on our website. From external business partners, such as social media sites, ad networks, and analytics providers. What are my rights and choices under European Area Countries laws? European Area Country residents have specific rights regarding their data. This section describes your rights if you are resident in the European Area Countries and explains how to exercise those rights. You may be entitled to ask us for a copy of any data which we hold. We will normally send you a copy within one month of your request. However, that period may be extended by two additional months where necessary, taking into account the complexity of the request or the difficulty in accessing the data that you request. There is usually no charge. In exceptional circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee after discussing the fee with you. If the data we hold about you is inaccurate, you may request rectification. The data will be checked, and, where appropriate, inaccuracies will be rectified. In certain circumstances, you may be entitled to ask us to erase your data. In certain circumstances, you may wish to move, copy, or transfer the electronic data that we hold about you to another organization. You may object to your data being used for direct marketing. You may object to the continued use of your data in any circumstances where we rely upon consent as the legal basis for Processing it. Where we rely upon legitimate interests as the legal basis for Processing your data, you may object to us continuing to Process your data, but you must give us specific reasons for objecting. We will consider the reasons you provide, but if we consider that there are compelling legitimate grounds for us to continue to Process your data, we may continue to do so. In that event, we will let you know the reasons for our decision. In some instances, objecting to certain Processing may impact our ability to provide you with services. We use limited data to operate the Platform and to carry out certain profiling activities to support and grow our business. When doing so, we rely upon our legitimate interests as the lawful basis for Processing your data, and you may exercise the above rights if you do not wish us to Process your data in this way. To exercise the rights in relation to your data set out in this section, please contact us at . Is my data transferred internationally? As a part of our standard business practices, we may transfer your data to organizations based in countries that have not been granted an adequacy decision under the General Data Protection Regulation. Where data is transferred to such countries, we shall ensure that specific safeguards or derogations have been established. These might include where the data transfer is necessary in order to fulfill a contract between us and yourself, where we have received your specific consent after having made you aware of any risks involved, or where contracts are in place between us and the Third-Parties involved that ensure the recipient organization has a suitable standard of data protection in place. You can contact our Data Protection Officer with questions, about this Policy, or about your data by writing to: Attn: BetterHelp UK: Data Protection Officer Ametros Group Ltd Lakeside Offices, Thorn Business Park Rotherwas Industrial Estate Hereford, Herefordshire England HR2 6JT 0330 223 2246 dpo@ametrosgroup.com Attn: BetterHelp EU: Data Protection Officer Ametros Ltd Unit 3D North Point House North Point Business Park New Mallow Road, Cork Ireland gdpr@ametrosgroup.com While we’ll always work with you to resolve any concerns you have about the use of your data, under GDPR you have the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in your country of residence if you have any concerns about our use of your personal information. Additional Privacy Notice for non-US, non-UK, and non-EU residents As a part of our standard business practices, data is transferred outside of many visitors’ countries of residence and predominantly used, accessed and processed within the U.S. Fortunately, given the robust and rigorous nature of privacy laws in the US, UK, and EU with which we comply, BetterHelp considers that this has the effect of protecting user information in a way that, overall, is at least substantially similar or in many ways exceeds non-US data privacy legal requirements. To the extent we contract with vendors who are outside of the U.S, we ensure that specific safeguards have been established to protect that data. SECTION 7 Defining key policy terms Process 1 In this Policy, we refer generally to activities done with data as "Processing" or "Process." Examples of Processing include collecting, storing, and using data. Third Party 2 For the purposes of this Policy, a Third Party means an entity that is not BetterHelp , not a , not a Therapist or any other parties that are specifically called out in this Policy. Connect you with therapy services 3 In order for us to connect you with therapy services on our Platform, we need to be able to facilitate information sharing between you and your Therapist so that you can get the help you need from them. We also Process data like your Therapist preferences, your state (if applicable), and your country to determine what Therapist to suggest to you based on applicable licensing or accreditation requirements. Facilitate tools for you and your Therapist 4 Once you start therapy, we need to process certain data to enable therapy tools within the Platform such as journal entries, setting goals and providing relevant worksheets. These help facilitate a more effective therapeutic experience and outcome. We Process Visitor Data, Account Data, Therapist Data, User ID, to verify your identity, secure your account (applicable to both Members and Therapists), and to monitor and protect the security of the Platform: We process certain data to make sure only you are able to access your account, and to place controls or challenges to prevent unauthorized access. We may also process some of your data when issuing security patches and bug fixes in order to address security risks. We may also process your data to track potential abuse on the platform, prevent and detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities. Communicate with you 5 For example, we need to make sure that if you ask a question or have a concern about the Platform, we’re able to respond to you and provide an answer. Monitor and improve therapy quality 6 For example, we track if a live session occurred, was canceled, or if the Therapist did not show up, to ensure that timely services are being delivered to you. We also track ratings, reviews, complaints, and other client feedback to ensure the quality of Therapists on our Platform. If you consent, a licensed Therapist who is employed as part of the BetterHelp Clinical Operations Team may review correspondence with your Therapist for quality assurance purposes. For example, if you raise a concern about your Therapist, or we have concerns about a specific Therapist’s clinical care. In addition, our internal Trust and Safety or Legal teams may review correspondence for specific accounts if we have a reason to believe that there is a security, legal, or fraud issue occurring with that specific account. Personalize your web or app experience 7 For example, if you identify as a Member of the LGBTQ+ community and would prefer a Therapist who has relevant expertise, experience, and training to provide therapy services for LGBTQ+ Members, we Process information to allow us to match you with an appropriate Therapist that can meet these needs. Another example is if you state that you would like help with anxiety, we may recommend content and features that would be helpful to you, such as anxiety-related group sessions. Help us understand how you use our services, how we can improve our products and services to make them more effective and convenient, and offer you new features 8 For example, we may use some of your data to determine which products and features to roll out to you, which features are popular and require more investment or resources, or decide to remove features that are not providing value. We may also Process data to know when you have already seen certain notifications on the Platform and do not need to be shown them again. Another example of this is when we use your IP address to help conveniently auto-populate your state (if applicable) and country, or assist you with providing your address when completing information about your emergency contact. We may also track regular usage of certain pages, buttons, or features on the Platform in order to allocate our research and development resources appropriately. In addition, if you opt in to Analytics (previously “Performance cookies”), we may process some data to track site visits across our sister sites such as ReGain and Teen Counseling. This is known as “first-party cross domain tracking”. Comply with laws 9 For example, a court might subpoena information from us where we would be required to share certain information requested in the subpoena. In addition, Therapists are subject to certain legal requirements and professional obligations to have a full record and/or complete information of the care and services they provide you ("Clinical Health Record"), which must be retained for a certain amount of time following the conclusion of your care. This is not unique to BetterHelp and is applicable to in-person therapy as well. Keep in mind that, as a general rule, we defer to your chosen Therapist to decide to produce (or not produce) any psychotherapy notes or messages you have had with them. Many jurisdictions have strict rules governing Therapist/client relationships and the confidentiality requirements associated with that. We encourage you to discuss with your Therapist early on if you have concerns about their disclosure obligations. Protect your safety and the safety of others 10 For example, if we have reason to believe that you or any other person may be in immediate danger or your privacy has been infringed upon, we may use the information to investigate or reach out to you or the appropriate authorities if it is legally appropriate/permitted to do so. Send you opportunities, promotions, news, updates and reminders about our services and your account 11 For example, we might email you to offer you special promotions or discounts. We might also email you to provide you with therapy related news or content that you might find interesting. You can opt out of receiving texts or marketing communications at any time. Service Provider 12 We define a Service Provider as a person or company that we have a legal agreement with to Process data collected by us or on our behalf. Data that is Processed on our behalf is required to be done only at our direction - no other person or company can authorize it. Our Service Providers are not permitted to disclose data that is individually identifiable to any other person or company, other than to us or the Service Providers’ own subcontractors provided that they’re bound to data Processing terms that are no less restrictive than the Service Provider’s terms. The data obtained by Service Providers from their relationship with us must only be used for performing the services specified in our agreement with them, or as reasonably necessary to perform one or more of the following: Comply with applicable law, regulation, or legal process; Detect, prevent or mitigate fraud or security vulnerabilities; Debug to identify and repair errors impairing existing intended functionalities; and/or Conduct internal research for technological development and demonstration of our products or services, if such use is reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose for which the data was shared.
