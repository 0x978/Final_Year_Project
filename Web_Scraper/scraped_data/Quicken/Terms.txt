The Membership Term is the amount of time for which you have full rights to use the Products and Services. The Membership Term is generally one (1) year, but we may sometimes offer trial Memberships of shorter duration. If you purchase your Membership directly from Quicken at Quicken.com, your Membership term starts at the time of purchase. For retail sales of a physical package (either through an online seller or in a physical store), or for retail sales via digital download other than on Quicken.com, the Membership Term begins at Product activation. At the end of the Membership Term some features and functionality of our Products and Services will no longer be available to you. However, you will still have access to your data and limited Product functionality as defined under the Quicken Data Access Guarantee (below). You acknowledge that the Products and Services are licensed and not sold. So long as you comply with the terms of this Membership Agreement and any other applicable terms and conditions, you are granted a personal, limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Products and Services during the Membership Term. Things You May Not Do. You agree that you will not do any of the following: You Are Responsible for Your Content. Neither we nor our Suppliers assume any responsibility or liability for any aspect of your Content. You agree that you will not upload, process, share, or link to any of the following: Quicken Has Certain Rights, Including the Right to Make Changes. The Products and Services are protected by copyright, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws. You are only granted the limited license described in this Agreement. We and our Suppliers reserve all other rights not specifically granted to you. This includes all ownership and license rights relating to a Product or Service. We reserve the right to change this Agreement at any time, and the changes will be effective when posted on our website or when we notify you by other means. Your continued use of a Product or Service following notice indicates your agreement to the changes. We May Communicate with You. You agree that we may use information obtained in connection with the Products and Services to communicate with you. If you provide a mobile number, we may communicate by voice or text messages to that number, and you are responsible for all charges incurred. You grant us and our Suppliers permission to use information about you and your experience to help us to provide the Products and Services, or to enhance the Products and Services. There may be times that we contact you to promote other services, products, or promotions offered by us or a Supplier. All such communications will comply with the Quicken Privacy Policy and with applicable law. You will be given a chance to opt out of promotional communications from us. Even if you opt out of promotional communications you will still receive required information about your account (such as transaction or account status information), communication you explicitly or implicitly opted to receive in the course of using the Product or Service (such as data based notifications or alerts sent via email or mobile devices), or other non-promotional communications delivered via email or in the Products (such as notifications of critical updates or usage reminders or help content). In some cases we are required by law to send you certain communications. You agree that we may use any method that we consider reasonable to send you these communications. If legally permitted, we may send such communications by email, via Product- or Service-wide message, or by posting on our website. Feedback and Your Communications to Us. You may be able to contact us to provide feedback, suggestions, ideas, or opinions (collectively "Feedback"). You agree that if you submit Feedback or other ideas of any type, Quicken may use them in any way, without compensating you, including in future modifications of Products and Services, in other Products or Services, in advertising or marketing materials, or in any other way we choose. You grant us a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable, sublicensable, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty free license to use these items in any way and without prior approval, and you hereby waive all of your moral rights in your Feedback in favor of us, our Suppliers, and our affiliates. We Do Not Provide Professional Advice. We never give legal, financial, accounting, tax, investment, healthcare, real estate, or other professional services or advice. In some cases we or a Supplier may make available prefilled forms or documents or other information as part of a Product or Service. These may include items such as IRS schedules, legal form agreements or other documents, real estate information (such as pricing), and financial market information. You agree that these things are provided solely as a convenience and for informational purposes. Regardless of how these items are described at the time they are offered, you agree to seek the services of a competent professional when you need this type of help, and you will not rely on these items in any material transaction or decision. Third-Party Products and Services. Some Products and Services have functionality that is provided by third parties (including our Suppliers in some cases). In some cases, Products and Services are provided by third parties entirely. All of these things are called Third-Party Products or Third-Party Services, or Third-Party Products and Services collectively. Third-Party Products and Services include things like (a) online payments services, (b) data downloaded from financial institutions for you to process within Products, (c) credit reporting or monitoring, (d) billing functionality, (e) data storage and management, (f) information services, (g) financial offerings, and (h) third-party forms and publications.

All such links are provided solely as a convenience, and do not constitute an endorsement or recommendation of any kind. We assume no liability in connection with your use of any such sites. Any Content you post or data that you upload is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of those sites and platforms. Please refer to those sites to better understand your rights and obligations. Payments and Subscriptions. For users other than Canada residents, payments will be billed to you in U.S. dollars, and your account will be debited when you provide your payment information, unless stated otherwise at the time of purchase. You must pay via a method acceptable to us, which may include a valid credit or debit card, funds transferred via electronic debit from a checking or savings account, or another payment option offered at the time of purchase. If your payment or registration information is not accurate, current, and complete, we may suspend or terminate all licenses and refuse any further use of Products and Services. In cases where you authorize repeat billing, we may participate in programs supported by your card provider (such as updater services, recurring billing programs, etc.) to try to update your payment information, and you agree that we may continue billing your account with the updated information that we obtain. For recurring Memberships, upon the end of your Membership Term we may automatically renew your periodic subscription at the then-current rates, unless you or we terminate this Agreement. If we are unable to charge your card, we may attempt to bill your card again until successful. Additional payment terms may be provided to you at the time of purchase. Quicken Data Access Guarantee. When your Membership ends certain features will no longer be available. These may include, without limitation, features such as download, data sync, mobile sync, quotes, and any other Products and Services that require online access or are provided by a third party (including our Suppliers).

The Paid Subscription is paid in full in advance and you will be charged the applicable subscription price stated at the time of purchase as one lump sum, plus applicable taxes. Payments will be billed to you in Canadian dollars. When you purchase a Paid Subscription, it will renew automatically at the end of the applicable subscription period, and we will bill you for an additional subscription term at the then-current price unless the Paid Subscription is cancelled or terminated under this Agreement. If you do not wish your Paid Subscription to auto-renew, you may opt out of auto-renewal at any time before the end of your current subscription period. If you cancel your Paid Subscription within 30 days of the start date of your initial subscription period, you will receive a full refund. If you cancel more than 30 days after the start date of your initial subscription period, you will not be entitled to a refund on any remaining portion of your Paid Subscription and will continue to have access to the Product or Service until the end of your contracted term. Cancellation can be requested at any time by visiting your My Account page or by contacting our Customer Service Centre at 1 (650) 250-1900.
