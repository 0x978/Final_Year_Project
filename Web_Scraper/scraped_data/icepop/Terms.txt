The measure covers attributes of wellbeing that were found to be important to older people in the UK. ICECAP-O is free to use, but the use of the measure must be registered with us first. More details on the registration, index values and applications of the ICECAP-O can be found on this website. The ICECAP-O descriptive system was developed in the UK using in-depth interviews with older people (aged 65+) and Framework analysis to generate conceptual attributes, with further semi-structured interviews to generate meaningful wording. A set of index values for the ICECAP-O have been estimated from a best-worst scaling study of older people in England. Anchors for the measure are at full capability and no capability. Qualitative and quantitative studies of the validity of the ICECAP-O have been conducted with both general population and patient samples.
