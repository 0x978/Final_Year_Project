In these circumstances the Customer shall, in accordance with any relevant guidance issued under the FOIA or EIR (or both), take reasonable steps, where appropriate, to give the other Parties advance notice, or failing that, to draw the disclosure to the other Parties’ attention after any such disclosure. 14.3 Notwithstanding any other provision in the Agreement, the Customer shall be responsible for determining in its absolute discretion whether any information relating to the Contractor, any Co-funders or the Deliverables is exempt from disclosure in accordance with the FOIA or the EIR (or both). 14.4 To the extent that any Co-funder is a public sector body subject to the requirements of the FOIA or the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (or both), then the provisions of clauses 14.1 to 14.3 shall also apply as if references in those clauses to ‘the Customer’ were references to that Co-funder. 15. 15.1 When handling Customer or any Co-funder data (or both), the Contractor shall ensure the security of the data is maintained in line with the security requirements of the Customer or Co-funder in question as notified to the Contractor from time to time. 15.2 The Contractor shall duly observe all its obligations under the Data Protection Legislation and shall provide all necessary assistance and cooperation as reasonably requested by the Customer to comply with its obligations under Data Protection Legislation which arise in connection with this Agreement. 15.3 Unless stated otherwise in Appendix 4 of the Order, the Parties acknowledge and agree that in connection with this Agreement neither Party will act as a Processor of the other (Processor having the meaning given to it in the UK GDPR). In the event that there is any change which requires either Party to act as a Processor the Parties agree, at their own cost, to enter into the standard data protection clauses set out in the Crown Commercial Services Procurement Policy Note 03/22 (as amended or replaced from time to time). 15.3.1 The Parties agree to take account of any guidance issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office. The Customer may, on not less than 30 Working Days’ notice to the Contractor and any Co-funders, amend this Agreement to ensure that it complies with Data Protection Legislation and any guidance issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office. The Contractor or any Co-funders (or both) will, at their own cost, implement any measures required for them to comply with requirements or recommendations of guidance issued by the Information Commissioner’s Office and with the terms of this Agreement. 15.3.2 Where the Customer has selected the further data protection provisions option in Section 26 (Further Data Protection Provisions) of the Order, the provisions of Annex 1 shall apply. 16. 16.1 No Party shall be responsible for any injury, loss, damage, cost or expense suffered by another Party if and to the extent that it is caused by the negligence or wilful misconduct of such other Party or by breach by the other Party of its obligations under the Agreement. 16.2 Subject always to clauses 16.3 and 16.4: 16.3 Nothing in the Agreement shall be construed to limit or exclude any Party’s liability for: 16.4 The Contractor’s liability: - under the indemnities in clauses 4.3 and 10.7 shall be unlimited - for breach of clause 15 or under any indemnity set out in this Agreement (or both) shall in each case be limited to the higher of: - £5,000,000 per claim - where applicable, the financial cap on liability specified in Section 24 (Special Terms) of the Order 16.5 Each Party must use all reasonable endeavours to mitigate any loss or damage which it suffers under or in connection with the Agreement, including any indemnities. 16.6 If more than one Contractor is party to the Agreement, each Contractor Party is fully responsible for both their own liabilities and the liabilities of the other Contractors. 16.7 Subject to clauses 16.1 and 16.3, the Customer does not accept any liability for any Losses the Contractor may incur or suffer arising from any access to the Customer’s premises and any labour and equipment that may be provided by the Customer in connection with the Deliverables. The Contractor acknowledges that, subject to the restrictions and limitations on liability set out in the remainder of this clause 16, any Losses suffered by a member of the Defra Group who is not a Co-funder that are caused by a breach, default, act, omission, negligence or statement of the Contractor or its staff, directors, officers, employees, agents, consultants or contractors shall be deemed to be defaults, claims, losses or damages that have been suffered by, and which are recoverable by, the Customer. 16.8 If one or more Co-funders is party to the Agreement, each Co-funder is fully responsible for its own liabilities and not the Customer. 17. No Party shall have any liability under or be deemed to be in breach of the Agreement for any delays or failures in performance of the Agreement which result from a Force Majeure Event provided the affected Party uses all reasonable measures practical to reduce the impact of the Force Majeure Event. Each Party shall promptly notify each other Party in writing when such circumstances cause a delay or failure in performance and when they cease to do so. If such Force Majeure Event continues for a continuous period of more than 30 days, any Party may terminate the Agreement by written notice to each other Party. Any failure or delay by the Contractor to perform its obligations under the Agreement that is due to a failure or delay by an agent, sub-contractor or Staff (or any combination of the 3) will only be considered a Force Majeure Event if that third party is itself prevented from complying with an obligation to the Contractor due to a Force Majeure Event. Where a Party terminates under this clause 17 each Party must cover its own Losses. 18. 18.1 In respect of the supply of Services, the Customer may terminate the Agreement at any time without reason or liability by notice in writing to the Contractor and any Co-funders to take effect on any date falling at least one month (or, if the Agreement is less than 3 months in duration, at least 10 Working Days) later than the date of service of the relevant notice. 18.2 Without prejudice to any other right or remedy it might have including any other express rights of termination set out in this Agreement, the Customer may terminate the Agreement in whole or in part by written notice to the Contractor with immediate effect if any of the following apply: 18.2.1 In the Customer’s reasonable opinion, the provision of the Deliverables (or any of them) will or is likely to conflict with the Customer’s statutory obligations or where applicable with the Customer’s obligations as a statutory consultee under any applicable legislation. 18.2.2 The Contractor (without prejudice to clause 18.2.6 or 18.2.10), is in material breach of any obligation under the Agreement which is not capable of remedy. 18.2.3 The Contractor repeatedly breaches any of the terms and conditions of the Agreement in such a manner as to reasonably justify the opinion that its conduct is inconsistent with it having the intention or ability to give effect to the terms and conditions of the Agreement. 18.2.4 (Without prejudice to clause 18.2.6 or 18.2.10) the Contractor is in material breach of any obligation which is capable of remedy, and that breach is not remedied within 30 days of the Contractor receiving notice specifying the breach and requiring it to be remedied. 18.2.5 The Contractor undergoes a change of control within the meaning of section 450 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 which isn’t preapproved by the Customer in writing. 18.2.6 The Contractor breaches the provisions of clauses 8.2, 13, 14, 15 or 19 (or any combination of these clauses). 18.2.7 The Contractor suffers an Insolvency Event. 18.2.8 The Contractor fails to comply with legal obligations in the fields of environmental, social or labour law. 18.2.9 The Contractor challenges or disputes the validity or ownership of any of the Customer’s or any Co-funder’s Existing IPR or (where Option A or Option B is selected in the Order, and in the case of the Customer only) New IPR. 18.2.10 The Contractor fails to meet any agreed milestone within either of the following time frames, or repeatedly fails over a period of 3 consecutive months to satisfy agreed milestones by their agreed milestone delivery dates as set out in the Specification: 18.2.11 The Contractor or any of its affiliates embarrass or bring the Customer or any Co-funders (or both) into disrepute or diminish the public trust in them. 18.3 The Contractor shall notify the Customer as soon as practicable of any change of control as referred to in clause 18.2.5 or any potential such change of control. 18.4 Any licences granted under this Agreement which expressly or by implication are without limitation of period shall continue notwithstanding any expiry or termination of this Agreement, save that the Customer and each of the Co-funders (if any) may terminate any licences granted by it to the Contractor immediately by notice in writing to the Contractor if the Contractor: 18.5 Termination or expiry of the Agreement shall be without prejudice to the rights of any Party accrued prior to termination or expiry and shall not affect the continuing rights of the Parties under clauses 2, 3.1, 4.3, 5.5, 5.6, 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 8, 10, 12.2, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18.6, 18.7, 19.4, 19.6, 20.4, 21, 11, 25.4, 25.9, 25.10, 25.12, 27.2 and 28 and any other term or condition of the Agreement that either expressly or by implication has effect after termination. Termination of any licences under clause 18.4 shall be without prejudice to any licences granted by the Contractor to the Customer or any Co-funders (or both), which shall remain in full force and effect. 18.6 Upon termination or expiry of the Agreement, the Contractor shall comply with the following: 18.6.1 At no cost give all reasonable assistance to the Customer, any Co-funders and any incoming contractor of Deliverables. 18.6.2 Return all property, requested documents, information and data belonging to the Customer or Co-funder (or both) to the Customer or relevant Co-funder (or both) as soon as reasonably practicable, with the exception of such information and materials belonging to the Customer and any Co-funders as are reasonably required by the Contractor to enjoy the benefit of any continuing licences granted to it under this Agreement 18.7 On termination under this clause 18 of any licences granted to the Contractor under this Agreement, the Contractor shall immediately destroy or, at the request of the Customer or Co-funder (as the case may be), return all information and materials belonging to the Customer or relevant Co-funder then in its or its contractors’ possession, custody or control, including all Confidential Information of the Customer or relevant Co-funder relating to such licences, and shall not retain any copies of the same. 18.8 As soon as it is aware of it the Contractor and Staff must report to the Customer any actual or suspected breach of Law. The Contractor must not retaliate against any of the Staff who in good faith reports a breach to the Customer or any other person. 18.9 Where the Customer terminates the Agreement under clauses 18.2 or 20.4.1 (or both), all of the following apply: 18.10 Where the Customer has the right to terminate the Agreement, it can terminate or suspend (for any period), all or part of it. If the Customer suspends the Agreement it can provide the Deliverables itself or buy them from a third party. 18.11 The Customer can only partially terminate or suspend the Agreement if the remaining parts of it can still be used to effectively deliver the intended purpose. 18.12 The Parties must agree any necessary variation where there is a suspension or partial termination of the Agreement by the Customer, but the Contractor may not either: 18.13 The Customer can still use other rights available, or subsequently available to it if it acts on its rights under clauses 18.10 to 18.12. 19. 19.1 The Contractor shall promptly notify the Customer of any health and safety hazards which may arise in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Agreement.

The Contractor must use all reasonable endeavours, and inform the Customer of the steps taken, to prevent anything that is considered to be unlawful discrimination by any court or tribunal, or the Equality and Human Rights Commission (or any successor organisation) when working on the Agreement. 19.2.7 Take all reasonable steps to secure the observance of clause 19.2.6 by all Staff. 19.2.8 Supply the Deliverables and any packaging in accordance with the Customer’s environmental policy as provided to the Contractor from time to time. 19.2.11 Ensure that it and its sub-contractors: 19.2.12 Ensure Staff and sub-contractors comply with the provisions of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 including Section 54 of the Act which requires certain organisations to publish annual modern slavery statements. 19.2.13 Throughout the duration of the Agreement: 19.3 The Contractor in the performance of this Agreement should use reasonable endeavours to adopt a sound proactive environmental approach, designed to minimise harm to the environment, to conserve energy, water, wood, paper and other resources, reduce waste and phase out the use of single-use plastic, ozone depleting substances and minimise the release of greenhouse gases, volatile organic compounds and other substances damaging to health or the environment (or both), and be able to provide proof of so doing to the Customer on demand. 19.4 The Contractor shall comply with, and shall ensure that its Staff shall comply with, the provisions of: 19.5 The Contractor shall ensure it has insurance cover for this Agreement that is in line with industry best practice and as set out in the Order. 19.6 The Contractor indemnifies the Customer, each member of the Defra Group and any Co-funders against any costs resulting from any default by the Contractor relating to any applicable Law to do with the Agreement. 20. 20.1 The Contractor shall not offer, give, or agree to give anything, to any person as an inducement or reward for doing, refraining from doing, or for having done or refrained from doing, any act in relation to the obtaining or execution of the Agreement or any other public function or for showing or refraining from showing favour or disfavour to any person in relation to the Agreement or any other public function. 20.2 The Contractor shall take all reasonable steps (including creating, maintaining and enforcing adequate policies, procedures and records), in accordance with good industry practice, to prevent fraud by the Staff and the Contractor (including its shareholders, members and directors) in connection with the Agreement and shall notify the Customer immediately if it has reason to suspect that any fraud has occurred or is occurring or is likely to occur. 20.3 If the Contractor notifies the Customer as required by clause 20.2, the Contractor must respond promptly to their further enquiries, co-operate with any investigation and allow the audit of any books, records and relevant documentation. 20.4 If the Contractor or the Staff engages in conduct prohibited by clause 20.1 or commits fraud in relation to the Agreement or any other agreement with the Crown (including the Customer) the Customer may take one of the following actions: 20.4.1 Terminate the Agreement and recover from the Contractor the amount of any loss suffered by the Customer, any member of the Defra Group or any Co-funders (or any combination of these Parties) resulting from the termination, including the cost reasonably incurred by the Customer of making other arrangements for the supply of the Deliverables and any additional expenditure incurred by the Customer, any member of the Defra Group or any Co-funders throughout the remainder of the Agreement. 20.4.2 Recover in full from the Contractor any other loss sustained by the Customer, any member of the Defra Group or any Co-funders in consequence of any breach of this clause. 20.4.3 Require the Contractor to remove any Staff from providing the Deliverables if their acts or omissions have caused the default. 21. 21.1 The contract managers of each Party shall attempt in good faith to negotiate a settlement to any dispute between the Parties arising out of or in connection with the Agreement within 14 days of a written request from another Party. If the contract managers are unable to settle the dispute any Party may on notice to the other escalate the dispute to an appropriately senior representative of each Party. 21.2 If the dispute cannot be resolved by the Parties within one month of being escalated as referred to in clause 21.1, the dispute may by agreement between the Parties be referred to a neutral adviser or mediator (the ‘Mediator’) using the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (‘CEDR’) Model Mediation Procedure current at the time of the dispute, with the Mediator chosen by agreement between the Parties or nominated by CEDR if the Parties cannot agree on a mediator within one month.

Any reference to Co-funder shall, where the context requires, be read in the plural where more than one Co-funder is a party to the Agreement. 24.3 If any Co-funders fail to make any payment in accordance with the Order, the Customer may issue a notice to the Contractor identifying the default of the relevant Co-funders and, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies, terminate the Agreement with immediate effect. 24.4 Each Co-funder agrees to comply with the obligations expressed to apply to the Customer in clause 7 with respect to that part of the Charges which is payable by the relevant Co-funder as set out in the Order. Any reference to ‘the Customer’ in clause 7 shall be interpreted as if it read “the Customer or the Co-funders, as the case may be”. 24.4.1 The Contractor shall not (and shall ensure that any other person engaged in relation to the Agreement shall not) say or do anything that might lead any other person to believe that the Contractor is acting as the agent or employee of the Co-funders. 25. 25.1 Each of the Parties represents and warrants to the others that it has full capacity and authority, and all necessary consents, licences and permissions to enter into and perform its obligations under the Agreement, and that the Agreement is executed by its duly authorised representative. 25.2 The Contractor warrants and represents that: 25.3 The warranties and representations in this Agreement made by the Contractor are repeated each time the Contractor provides Goods or Services (or both) under the Agreement. 25.4 The Contractor indemnifies the Customer, each member of the Defra Group and any Co-funders against each of the following: 25.5 If the Contractor becomes aware of a representation or warranty made in relation to the Agreement that becomes untrue or misleading, it must immediately notify the Customer. 25.6 All third party warranties and indemnities covering the Goods or Services (or both) must be assigned for the Customer’s and any Co-funder’s benefit by the Contractor. 25.7 Save in relation to any rights or benefits which are conferred on members of the Defra Group, a person who is not a party to the Agreement shall have no right to enforce any of its provisions which, expressly or by implication, confer a benefit on him, without the prior written agreement of the Parties. No third parties (other than members of the Defra Group) may use the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (‘CRTPA’) to enforce any term of the Agreement unless stated (referring to CRTPA) in the Agreement. 25.8 The Agreement cannot be varied except in writing signed by a duly authorised representative of the Parties. Any such amendments may be made by the Parties without the consent of any members of the Defra Group (other than the Customer). 25.9 The Agreement contains the whole agreement between the Parties and supersedes and replaces any prior written or oral agreements, representations or understandings between them. The Parties confirm that they have not entered into the Agreement on the basis of any representation that is not expressly incorporated into the Agreement. Nothing in this clause shall exclude liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation. 25.10 Any waiver or relaxation either partly, or wholly of any of the terms and conditions of the Agreement shall be valid only if it is communicated to each other Party in writing and expressly stated to be a waiver. A waiver of any right or remedy arising from a breach of agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any right or remedy arising from any other breach of the Agreement. 25.11 The Agreement shall not constitute or imply any partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary relationship or other relationship between the Parties other than the contractual relationship expressly provided for in the Agreement. No Party shall have, nor represent that it has, any authority to make any commitments on any other Party’s behalf. 25.12 Except as otherwise expressly provided by the Agreement, all remedies available to any Party for breach of the Agreement (whether under the Agreement, statute or common law) are cumulative and may be exercised concurrently or separately, and the exercise of one remedy shall not be deemed an election of such remedy to the exclusion of other remedies. 25.13 If any provision of the Agreement is prohibited by law or judged by a court to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, the provision shall, to the extent required, be severed from the Agreement and rendered ineffective as far as possible without modifying the remaining provisions of the Agreement, and shall not in any way affect any other circumstances of or the validity or enforcement of the Agreement. 25.14 Each Party will, at the request and cost of another Party, do all things which may be reasonably necessary to give effect to the meaning of this Agreement. 25.15 Nothing in this Agreement shall prejudice, conflict with or affect the exercise by the Customer of its statutory functions, powers, rights, duties, responsibilities or obligations arising or imposed under any Law, legislative provision enactment, bye-law or regulation whatsoever, nor shall it fetter the exercise of any discretion the Customer may have. 26. 26.1 Any notice to be given under the Agreement shall be in writing and may be served by personal delivery, first class recorded or, subject to clause 26.3, email to the address of the relevant Party set out in the Order, or such other address as that Party may from time to time notify to the other or others in accordance with this clause. 26.2 Notices served as above shall be deemed served on the Working Day of delivery provided delivery is before 5:00pm on a Working Day. Otherwise, delivery shall be deemed to occur on the next Working Day. An email shall be deemed delivered when sent unless an error message is received. 26.3 Notices under clauses 17 and 18 may be served by email only if the original notice is then sent to the recipient by personal delivery or recorded delivery in the manner set out in clause 26.1. 26.4 This clause does not apply to the service of legal proceedings or any documents in any legal action, arbitration or dispute resolution. 27. 27.1 ‘Conflict of Interest’ for the purpose of this clause 27 shall mean a conflict between the financial or personal duties of the Contractor or the Staff and the duties owed to the Customer or any Co-funders (or both) under the Agreement, in the reasonable opinion of the Customer. 27.2 The Contractor must take action to ensure that neither the Contractor nor the Staff are placed in the position of an actual, potential or perceived Conflict of Interest. 27.3 The Contractor must promptly notify and provide details to the Customer if an actual, potential or perceived Conflict of Interest happens or is expected to happen. 27.4 The Customer will consider whether there are any appropriate measures that can be put in place to remedy an actual, perceived or potential Conflict of Interest. If, in the reasonable opinion of the Customer, such measures do not or will not resolve an actual or potential Conflict of Interest, the Customer may terminate the Agreement immediately by giving notice in writing to the Contractor where there is or may be an actual or potential Conflict of Interest shall apply. 28.
