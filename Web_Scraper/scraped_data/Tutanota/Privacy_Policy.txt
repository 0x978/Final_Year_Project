We fight surveillance capitalism. Today’s internet is broken. Surveillance capitalists use their power and knowledge to profile you and determine your value as a consumer. They infringe your privacy every single day. They decide what you see. They place algorithm-based information in front of you, subtly and constantly so that in the end they influence your thoughts, your decisions, your actions. These companies do this for their own benefit. Business models based on data collection and data exploitation must be stopped. We fight for a different internet. One where privacy by design is the foundation. Because each and everyone of us deserves freedom and privacy, online and offline, today and tomorrow.
