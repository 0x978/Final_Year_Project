When you use the Services, we use a variety of electronic tools, such as cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies (collectively referred to in this Privacy Policy as “cookies”) to automatically generate information about how you use and interact with the Services as discussed in this section. What are Cookies? Cookies are small files of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer, or small graphic images placed on web pages or in emails. They can be stored either for a single browser session or more permanently. We use cookies to collect information about your browsing activities, distinguish you from other users, provide functionality, and analyze use of the Services. Our third-party partners, such as analytics and advertising partners, may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across different services. The types of cookies we and third parties may use to collect information are as follows: You can find more information about your rights and choices, and how to block the use of certain cookies in the section Your Rights and Choices below.

We receive information about the device and software you use to access our Services, including internet protocol (IP) address, Internet Service Provider, web browser type, operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application installations, device type and identifiers, and mobile advertising identifiers.

We do not collect precise geolocation data. Usage Information. To help us understand and analyze how you use our Services and to help us improve them, we automatically receive information about your interactions with our Services, like the pages or other content you view or interact with, the searches you conduct, your comments, any content you enter or post, commands you type, and the dates and times of your visits. C. Information We Receive from Third Parties. Information from third party services. If you choose to link our Services to a third-party account, we may receive information about you, including your profile information and your photo, and your use of the third-party account, in accordance with your settings on such third-party account. If you wish to limit the information available to us, you should visit the privacy settings of your third-party accounts to learn about your options. Other third parties. We may receive additional information about you, such as demographic data, from third parties such as data or marketing partners and combine it with other information we have about you. We use the information we collect: De-Identified Information. Please note that we may de-identify the information we collect from and about you so that it can no longer be reasonably linked to you or your device. Once information has been de-identified in this way, we can use and share it for any purpose in our discretion, and this Privacy Policy no longer applies to such information. Replit provides you with the ability to publish content that could be used to collect personally identifiable information from its users. If you publish such content, it is your responsibility to understand your legal obligations and to comply with all applicable laws, including: Various global privacy laws (such as those in the European Economic Area, United Kingdom, and Brazil) require that we have a “legal basis” to process your information. The legal bases on which we rely to process your information include: How We Share the Information We Collect We share information with the following categories of third parties. Affiliates. We may share any information we receive with our corporate affiliates under common ownership or control for any of the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Service Providers. We may share any information we receive with vendors retained in connection with the provision of our Services and that process your information on our behalf. These entities may include analytics, billing, legal support, marketing, security, machine learning, and fraud prevention companies. Other Users and Individuals. Our Services are social services in which you can find, collaborate on, and share content. Your profile, including your name, user name, profile picture, code, and other profile information (but not your email address or phone number) will always be viewable and searchable by other users and search indexed by online search engines. The content you post to the Services, including your code and forum posts, will be displayed on the Services and viewable by other users by default. The “Your Preferences” section of this Privacy Policy describes the controls that you can use to limit the sharing of your code. We are not responsible for the other users’ use of available information, so you should carefully consider whether and what to post or how you identify yourself on the Services. Please note that student profiles created by teachers using Teams for Education and students’ code are never publicly viewable or searchable, and students may not post content on publicly viewable forums. Third Party App Integrations. If you connect a third-party application to our Services, we may share information such as code with that third party. As Required by Law and Similar Disclosures. We may access, preserve, and disclose your information if we believe in good faith that doing so is required or appropriate to: (a) comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoenas; (b) respond to your requests; or (c) protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety. For the avoidance of doubt, the disclosure of your information may occur if you post any objectionable content on or through the Services. Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers. We may disclose and transfer your information to service providers, advisors, potential transactional partners, or other third parties in connection with the consideration, negotiation, or completion of a corporate transaction in which we are acquired by or merged with another company or we sell, liquidate, or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Consent. We may also disclose information from or about you with your permission. Your Rights and Choices Sharing Preferences. If you prefer to not have others see your code, you can upgrade to make that code private. If you import code from GitHub and your repository is public, it will remain public by default on Replit. If you wish to import code from GitHub and your repository is private, you can upgrade to ensure that your code will also remain private on Replit. Marketing Communications. You can unsubscribe from our promotional emails via the link provided in the emails. Even if you opt-out of receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us. How to Block Cookies. You can change your browser settings to block, disable, or notify you when you receive a Cookie, delete Cookies, or browse our Services using your browser’s anonymous usage setting. However, if you use your browser settings to block all Cookies (including essential Cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our Services, or some portions of the Services may not function properly. Your European Privacy Rights. If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, you have the additional rights described below. You may exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details at the end of this Privacy Policy. Before responding to your request, we may ask you to provide reasonable information to verify your identity. Please note that there are exceptions and limitations to each of these rights, and that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases instantly or within a reasonable period of time, we may retain information for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so. Third Parties Our Services may contain links to other websites, products, or services that we do not own or operate. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these third parties. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to your activities on these third-party services or any information you disclose to these third parties. We encourage you to read their privacy policies before providing any information to them. Retention We take measures to delete your information or maintain it in a de-identified form when it is no longer necessary to be kept in identifiable form for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period. When determining the specific retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of service provided to you, the nature and length of our relationship with you, and mandatory retention periods provided by applicable law and any statute of limitations. When you request to delete your account, we delete your data within 30 days. Security We use a variety of technical, organizational, and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the information we maintain.
