I’ve been working with the AppValley owner for 3+ years now and I want to make sure the community is aware of what’s going on and is safe when using AppValley. There are still many confused about this situation and I’m here to try and clear it up. AppValley was started by a couple of people (partners) and everything was pretty normal. Only one twitter account, one service. One partner (Jason Wu) decided to be greedy and change some passwords to the twitter account, domain etc to try and essentially steal the company. This is where we are at today. The official AppValley had to get a new domain, new twitter etc and rely on the trust of users to keep them from being forgotten and help them build back up their huge following. We need you to spread awareness about this terrible act and help the official AppValley regain the trust they deserve and bring down the imposters.

[deleted] 3 points Are there supposed to be ads in the apps??? 9 points 10 points 11 points I would love to use you guys but everything is always “unavailable” Are you using the brave browser? For a lot of websites you have to turn off the shields because it can block a lot more than just trackers. Especially on layered sites. No I was on iOS I didn’t know you can use this for pc I mean there are emulators and such, but yea. IDK what the problem is. Do you have a VPN up or something? No I have no idea what the issue could be then. Try downloading it on your phone and then seeing if you can download apps, it’ll say unavailable I can't instal the real appvally what's going on? Are you getting an error? What’s going on? 4 points I used to use the “original” app ballet but changed to the other one as your Spotify ++ was filled with ads and became unuseable 5 points 6 points Hey I love u guys but mine says that everything is unavailable. I have an iPhone 6s Plus just wanted to see if it’s just my device Nope it’s for everyone, we are revoked. any idea when you'll have spotify back up? Thank you for this announcement. Just realised I’ve been using the fake one, now got the real one. Looks better and has better range of apps. The other guy’s an asshole comment score below threshold -8 points -7 points -6 points GTFO WITH THIS S$it lol let’s just make the claim that both of you have malware, this post is garbage seriously, please both appvalleys just do us a favor disappeared, thanks in advance This ain’t it chief. ok -3 points -2 points -1 points The app doesn’t work anyway! All of the applications say unavailable. Waste of time! 7 points Well they were up earlier today, we were revoked again and we are looking for a new certificate. Not sure what you used to redact that document but I can tell you it’s not correct. The redactions are an overlay on top of the actual document and with a typical internet connection, the document will appear fully before the redactions pop up. I would recommend redacting it and uploading a still image of the document without any layering. Not sure what you used to redact that document but I can tell you it’s not correct.

To be fair it’s just names and locations anyways 8 points Yea Jason already publicly doxxed me so I don’t really care at this point... Good luck. He is a resident of China. All we need is court orders for American companies we aren’t after his money. Yeah but what would that do for everything based in China. These apps already break terms and conditions and are subject to liability themselves I have absolutely no idea what the question is here. What would it do for everything based in China? I don’t understand sorry :P maybe I’m dumb hahah What difference does it make to sue if they’re based in China? What would a judgement from a US court effect? I don’t see how a win could really happen. Side loaded apps aren’t really “legal” as far as terms and conditions go?! So taking it to US court wouldn’t that fuel a fire from the respective owners of the actual apps? What difference does it make to sue if they’re based in China?

So taking it to US court wouldn’t that fuel a fire from the respective owners of the actual apps? This isn’t a US court, see chancery division. It’s hard to explain, we will both have to just see how court plays out Agreed. Quick question. Why did the other one not get revoked They are on the same certificate they are revoked, just haven’t woken up to realize it yet because he’s in a China time zone Ha! -4 points The so called "fake" one has a verified profile and you don't, how come ? Whether the profile is signed or not has nothing to do with the legitimacy of either service. Anyone can sign a profile, we chose not to. -5 points If the two partners split, neither is official until you both grow up and sort it out. Thanks! This whole thing had multiple misnomers and improper wording. Reading the document only made me believe this version of the story less. 12 points 13 points 14 points One stole the accounts. Not really a split If the partnership split, it would be inaccurate (and legally prejudicial) to describe one partner as having “stolen” the accounts. This is simply a dispute between partners. If the partnership split, it would be inaccurate (and legally prejudicial) to describe one partner as having “stolen” the accounts. This is simply a dispute between partners. Never split, guy took the stuff and left. Why do you think there’s a lawsuit? For fun and games? Because we got butthurt? You’re describing a split. The partners have fallen out and disagreed on how to divide the assets between them. I didn’t describe anything. Didn’t write the post a staff member did and if that person misconceived what happened that’s on them. There was no split, it was simple. He took everything and stole money then left. Partners jointly own the assets of their partnership. You cannot steal something that already belongs to you. One of the partners has moved something that they jointly own. The other partner is unhappy about it. This is simply a dispute between partners. Going to court is one way to arbitrate the dispute. Partners jointly own the assets of their partnership. You cannot steal something that already belongs to you. One of the partners has moved something that they jointly own. The other partner is unhappy about it. This is simply a dispute between partners. Going to court is one way to arbitrate the dispute. 3 partners. One took all assets and proceeded to leave. Would you like to be our lawyer? 🤣 The filing itself only talks about civil law. It’s not a criminal complaint, right? There’s no allegation of stealing — it’s breach of contract (ie. a dispute), with a bunch of other stuff sprinkled in. I wasn’t meaning to be a pain — I just didn’t like the “stolen” bit, as it oversimplies the matter and doesn’t fit with the allegations in the lawsuit. I wish you the best of luck with it. It’s a horrible situation to be in, and I hope you can sort it out with as little stress and expense as possible. 🙏 The filing itself only talks about civil law. It’s not a criminal complaint, right?

We’ve spent at least $30,000-45,000 so far. So definitely sucks, and that is one of the first revisions of the actual lawsuit. I have the final revision in my files which is more in depth than this complaint. Why is every app listed as unavailable? The real question! We’re revoked I didn’t realize I had the fake one so I downloaded the real one and spotify++ but the Spotify doesn’t have “browse” as an option on the bottom menu bar. Anyone know why that is? Probably the Spotify update that everyone was complaining about months ago, you had an older version Yeah I’m just now realizing they basically just combined browse and search under one tab. Doesn’t seem like that big of a deal I consider this the fake appvalley and the other one the real one. What do you have to say about that? they claim malware to scare people from using the other appvalley, in the end they provide the exact same thing, one could say that this appvalley has malware as well, we can’t prove either one Never had a single problem I’ve had the other AppValley for quite some time, and have never had any problems. This seems a little bias, coming from you, who works with this AppValley. Any sources (that are trustable) from people not working there? The lawsuit does. And verified “profile” is nothing but a green check by using ssl. We could do the same but there’s legitimately no point haha Ffs i just downloaded the fake one. Im on limited data plan you know, if only i’ve seen this earlier 21 points 22 points 23 points this post is really enlightening, thanks op. sorry if this is a dumb question - I’ve apparently been using the fake appvalley app since forever, is there anything else i can do to get rid of any potential malware or just remove the profiles and apps? this post is really enlightening, thanks op. sorry if this is a dumb question - I’ve apparently been using the fake appvalley app since forever, is there anything else i can do to get rid of any potential malware or just remove the profiles and apps? 16 points 17 points 18 points Removing the profile and apps are a great start. Maybe change your social passwords as a secondary precaution :) thanks so much! Developer - appDB 15 points Jesus he ended up in jail? Wow Yes, but not for this. For raping. Anyway he was not good person. I hope we receive good results in our lawsuit... this is out of hand but thank you for your support guys. Means a lot Good people that are doing good things are always winning! Hope you will win this case. Been like $25,000-30,000 in legal fees by now... thanks again for the support though!!

In the future, please be sure to follow the rules when posting on the subreddit. Happy Sideloading! I was one of the loyal but careless followers of appvalley and downloaded the fake one. That’s just because of how their profile was tagged as verified and yet the real one was not. At that time when I had the fake one, I’ve been getting random logins to my email (I have security key and two factor authenticated) from Colombia but I’m not sure if that’s related or a totally different thing. Anyway, my online personal information is safe (I think) and will be taking steps to make sure that I download and get update from the legit one. Thanks for clearing this out. Use haveIbeenpwned to check if your email has been compromised and shared online. I was also getting attempted logins in many of my games mainly ubisoft and blizzard. After I checked I found out my email was compromised from a security breach in Canvas and my email and password combination was posted 3 times to the public. It hunk at the time of when they were getting hijacked, I think someone was trying hard to access my Facebook account, since I constantly kept getting text messages to reset my password... Glad this cleared things up We’re aware Thank you for this post, I am new and was very confused by the two twitter accounts and app download pages This is legitimate π Rendered by PID 57 on reddit-service-r2-loggedout-64b57b747d-rfxgl at 2023-12-18 08:40:05.224993+00:00 running 252de61 country code: GB. π Rendered by PID 57 on reddit-service-r2-loggedout-64b57b747d-rfxgl at 2023-12-18 08:40:05.224993+00:00 running 252de61 country code: GB.
