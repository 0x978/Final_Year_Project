This service can license user content to third parties. Instead of asking directly, this Service will assume your consent merely from your usage.. When the service wants to make a material change to its terms, users are notified at least 30 days in advance. This service reserves the right to disclose your personal information without notifying you. This service forces users into binding arbitration in the case of disputes. You waive your right to a class action.. The court of law governing the terms is in a jurisdiction that is friendlier to user privacy protection (California, USA). There is a date of the last update of the agreements. The court of law governing the terms is State of California (U.S.). Invalidity of any portion of the Terms of Service does not entail invalidity of its remainder. This service keeps a license on user-generated content even after users close their accounts.. Failure to enforce any provision of the Terms of Service does not constitute a waiver of such provision
