DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN YOU AND COLLEGE BOARD-ARBITRATION This Section 12 applies to the extent allowable by law and to the extent not already provided for in Service Specific Terms. If you think we’ve done something wrong, please let us know and hopefully we can resolve your issues. But if we can’t, then these rules will govern legal disputes between you and College Board involving College Board Services: All disputes between you and College Board that relate in any way to these Legal Terms or to College Board Services, but excluding claims that a party violated the intellectual property rights of the other party, shall exclusively be resolved by a single arbitrator through binding, individual arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time a request for arbitration is filed with the AAA. Copies of the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules can be located at adr.org. Any dispute as to arbitrability shall be resolved by the arbitrator. Arbitration will be conducted on a documents-only basis (i.e., there will be no in-person or telephone hearing) unless otherwise agreed by the parties or required by the arbitrator. Should the parties agree to, or should the arbitrator require proceedings, such proceedings should be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the parties agree that the proceedings will be conducted via a video or telephonic call or, in the event that face-to-face proceedings are agreed to by the parties or required by the arbitrator, at a location that is reasonably convenient to both parties in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. The parties agree that the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. governs this provision, and it is the intent of the parties that the FAA shall preempt all State laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. New York law otherwise applies to these Legal Terms, without regard to choice-of-law principles. No arbitration may be maintained as a class or collective action, and the arbitrator shall not have the authority to combine or aggregate the disputes of more than one individual, conduct any class or collective proceeding, make any class or collective award, or make an award to any person or entity not a party to the arbitration, without the express written consent of College Board. By agreeing to arbitration in accordance with this Section, you are waiving your right to have your dispute heard by a judge or jury. Each party will be responsible for its own fees and expenses and any legal fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. This does not preclude the arbitrator from granting relief in accordance with AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules. GOVERNING LAW, VENUE AND WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL These Legal Terms shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York without regard to choice or conflict of law principles. All disputes arising from or related to these Legal Terms that are not subject to arbitration under the arbitration sections above shall be resolved exclusively in the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York State and you and College Board irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of such courts. You and College Board expressly waive any right to a jury trial in any lawsuit arising from or related to these Legal Terms. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES (LIMITS TO WHAT/HOW MUCH YOU CAN SUE US FOR) Limitation of College Board’s Liability EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT FINALLY DETERMINED TO BE PROHIBITED BY LAW, COLLEGE BOARD’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU OR ANYONE CLAIMING BY OR THROUGH YOU OR ON YOUR BEHALF, FOR ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, COSTS, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING FROM OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO COLLEGE BOARD, COLLEGE BOARD SERVICES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY TEST ADMINISTRATION BY COLLEGE BOARD, FROM ANY CAUSE, SHALL NOT EXCEED THE REGISTRATION FEES YOU PAID FOR THE PARTICULAR COLLEGE BOARD SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE DISPUTE OR $100.00, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.
