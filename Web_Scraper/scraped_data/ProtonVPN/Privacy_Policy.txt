When you use the Service, we do NOT do any of the following: Our free VPN service is also covered by our no-logs policy, and has in general no speed restrictions. We do reserve the right to impose speed restrictions in cases of excessive consumption in order to ensure service quality for all users on free servers. All Proton VPN servers are encrypted and we do not log VPN session data. Data security: All information required to maintain your account are managed by servers that are wholly owned and operated by Proton or our subsidiaries. This data is always stored in encrypted format on our servers, which are exclusively located in Switzerland or Germany, under the protection of some of the world's strongest privacy laws. Furthermore, Proton physically owns and operates all Secure Core servers, and a majority of our VPN servers in Switzerland and Germany (Proton owned servers can be identified by IP addresses which identify Proton AG as the internet service provider). All Proton VPN servers, irrespective of location, utilize full-disk encryption, and in the highly unlikely event that the full-disk encryption is compromised, Proton VPN servers also contain no logs and no user data.
