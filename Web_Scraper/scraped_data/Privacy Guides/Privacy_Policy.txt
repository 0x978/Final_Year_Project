As a visitor to our website: If you register for an account on one of our services, we may collect any information you provide us (such as your email, password, profile information, etc.) and use that information to provide you with the service. We never share or sell this data. Even in the limited cases where your data is collected, our volunteers and most members of the Privacy Guides team have no access to that information. Some information (such as your email address) may be accessible to moderators via limited control panels for the purposes of moderating our communities. Thus, inquiries regarding your personal information should be sent directly to: Jonah Aragon Services Administrator jonah@privacyguides.org For all other inquiries, you can contact any member of our team.
