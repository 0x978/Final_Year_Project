Mojeek doesn't implement any kind of specific user tracking, whether that be at the time of visit or subsequently via standard logs, which Mojeek does keep indefinitely. These logs contain the time of visit, page requested, possibly referral data, and located in a separate log browser information. IP addresses are not recorded, instead the IP address is replaced with a simple two letter code indicating the visitors country of origin. By doing this, Mojeek removes any possibility of tracking or identifying any particular user. We use a URL parameter to monitor if a campaign landing page visit results in a Mojeek search request. This parameter is visible in the URL and is not used after the first search. The remaining log data (country, time/date, page requested, referral data, and in a separate log browser data), which although now contains no identifiable data, would still in no situation whatsoever be sold or distributed to any third party vendors. This data is kept private for the sole purpose of storing historical traffic volumes and country demographics of our visitors. We may also use aggregate, non-personal search data to improve our results. The Mojeek website contains links to other websites. This privacy policy only applies to this website. When you proceed to other websites via our links, our privacy policy is void. We do not outsource any development of Mojeek to third parties; all development is kept in-house. We pride ourselves on limiting the number of third party products and services that Mojeek consumes.
