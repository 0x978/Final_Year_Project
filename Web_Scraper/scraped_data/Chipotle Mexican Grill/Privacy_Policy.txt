We will disclose this type of information to third party service providers to help us run these analytics.

Collection, Use, and Disclosure of Personal Information We collect personal information directly from you and from advertising networks, internet service providers, data analytics providers, government entities, operating systems and platforms, social networks, and data brokers. We do not collect all categories of personal information from each source. During the 12 months leading up to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, we “sold” or “shared” (as these terms are defined under California law) commercial information (transaction data), and internet or other network or device activity (like a record of a browser’s visit to our Website) for marketing and advertising purposes to advertising providers, analytics companies, and social media networks. We do not “sell” or “share” personal information if we have actual knowledge that the consumer is less than 18 years of age. We do not use sensitive personal information for purposes other than those allowed by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and its regulations. Your Deletion & Correction Rights You may request that we: Data Request Form We will take reasonable steps verify your identity before responding to your request, which may include, at a minimum, depending on the sensitivity of the information you are requesting and the type of request you are making, verifying your name, email address, and other information regarding your use of the Services (e.g., date of last purchase or last 4 digits of a payment/gift card). Opt Out Targeted Advertising or the “Sale” or “Sharing” of Personal Information You may direct us not to “sell” or “share” certain personal information or use your personal information for targeted advertising as these terms are defined in state privacy laws. You can exercise these rights by: · Clicking on “Your Privacy Choices ” in our Website footer and toggling off Non Essential Targeting, Social Media, Analytics, & Functional Cookies. Completing this step will opt out you out of targeted advertising or the “sale” or “sharing” facilitated through web-initiated device tracking. · Contacting us by phone at 833-506-0473 to make a general request.

Requests Made by Agents If you are an agent making a request on behalf of a consumer, we reserve the right to take steps to verify that you are authorized to make that request, which may include requiring you to provide us with written proof, such as a power of attorney. As part of the process, we may additionally require the consumer to verify their identity directly with us. For security and legal reasons, Chipotle will reject requests that require us to access third-party websites or services. Privacy Metrics Below is the status of privacy requests for the previous year, detailing the number of requests to know, access, delete and requests to opt out of sale and sharing that we received, complied with, and denied as well as the mean number of days within which we responded to each privacy request. Request type CY (For 12 months starting on or after May 30,2022) Number of Requests Received Request Fulfilled Request Rejected Total Delete My Personal Information CY2022 542 1,080 1,575 3,197 CY2023 166 122 262 550 Right to Know 1 58 4 63 0 5 6 Right to Access 56 2 Right to Correct CY 2023 Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information 79 167 365 611 113 16 130 850 1,545 2,225 4,620 Average - Request Complete in days Median - Request Complete in days 6.97 2.00 Do Not Sell or Share My Personal information 7 Request Complete in days = Date Request opened – Date Request closed 7.50 Nondiscrimination We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights. Notice of Financial Incentives The Chipotle Rewards Program lets participants earn or otherwise receive rewards (e.g., free entrees) and discounts, in return for registering and/or making purchases, including: registering on our Website You may withdraw from the Rewards Program at any time and forfeit any ongoing incentives through your online or App account or by contacting us using the contact information below. Please also note that if you submit a request to delete your personal information, this will also automatically withdraw you from the Rewards Program and will result in the forfeiture of your incentives, including your Rewards points that you may have accumulated. Requesting the deletion of your personal information results in the deletion of your Rewards account and accumulated incentives because we require your personal data (e.g., your name, email address, and log-in information) to be able to associate you to your account. You may elect to rejoin the Rewards program at any time, at which time we will once again begin collecting your personal information. The value of Personal Information we collect is reasonably related to our expenses related to offering the Rewards Program. While we do not and cannot assign a monetary value to the personal information we collect through the Rewards Program, we do benefit financially from the Rewards Program. For example, although we may lose immediate revenue when a member uses a discount, the positive experience may lead to an overall increase in visits to our restaurants. Calculating the actual value that Chipotle generates from those efforts (whether in aggregate or by individual) or a monetary value of the personal information involved is impossible. There are many reasons for this: · First, the information is of no monetary value by itself, as Chipotle achieves personal information-related benefits only when the information is used in combination with, and in the context of, other aspects of our business such as (1) high-quality marketing efforts, (2) the compelling financial components of our Rewards Program that do not require use of the personal information, such as the ability to earn discounts and rewards, (3) the high quality of our food and service, and (4) the proximity of our restaurants to Rewards Program members. · Second, we cannot precisely determine the motivating factors of any specific purchase, or the relative weights of each factor. Even if somebody redeems a coupon we sent to the contact information they supplied during Rewards Program registration, we cannot determine whether they would have made the same purchase on the same day even without the coupon. In a lot of households, Tuesday is taco Tuesday – coupon or not. · Third, the level of engagement with our uses of personal information varies among Rewards Program members. For example: (i) some members may have elected to receive all of our marketing content, while others have limited the type or amount of marketing materials we send them, or (ii) some live next door to one of our restaurants, while others are out of delivery range. · Fourth, the dining habits of our Rewards Program members appear to vary significantly. · Fifth, not all members link their purchases to their Rewards Program membership, so we cannot identify all purchases by Rewards Program members, let alone which ones were influenced by their participation in the program. For these reasons, we estimate that the value of the personal information collected for the Rewards Program would be less than the value the individual receives from their participation in the Reward Program. California “Shine the Light” Rights Subject to certain limitations under California’s Shine the Light law, California residents may contact us as described at the end of this Privacy Policy to request a list of third parties to whom we disclosed certain personal information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the preceding year. The information we will provide will describe our general practices in the prior calendar year and will not be specific to you. Your request should indicate that you are a California resident, and you must provide your full current California address, to which we will send our response. Your inquiry must specify “Shine the Light Request” in the subject line of the email or the first line of the letter, and include your California address. We are only required to respond to one such request per individual each year. We may take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request. 9.

By visiting one of these linked websites or services, you are subject to their privacy and other policies.
