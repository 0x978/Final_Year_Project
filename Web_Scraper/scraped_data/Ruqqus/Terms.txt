Welcome to Reddit, the front page of the internet. and join one of thousands of communities. 59 61 () submitted by Ruqqus is a tremendously promising platform, with a dedicated and very gifted team of three admin-developers who do great work and - much to the platform‚Äôs detriment - stand unconditionally by the laissez-faire mission statement of the site, to allow all legal speech minus a few clear-cut exceptions (doxxing, sexualization of even fictional minors) which are great exceptions. The platform is feature-rich with more added and improved regularly, it‚Äôs got a substantially large userbase, and an excellent interface. Funding is taken care of for awhile thanks to a Bitcoin donation. The Discord server is active and the admin-devs routinely and transparently engage with the userbase, there and on-site. But Ruqqus is failing despite a sustained spike in user activity, and is doomed to continue to fail, without common sense community standards in place. In its current state, there is no ‚ÄúRuqqus community‚Äù and there are no communities on Ruqqus. There‚Äôs nothing on Ruqqus anymore except ancient reposts of old MDE and *chan garbage posted and reposted there ad nauseam, endless link spam to various far right blogs, and screenshots of anti-black/jew/trans news articles. Aside from a few guilds whose purpose is ‚Äúpost pictures of cool things about X‚Äù (shoutout to +aesthetic, +architecture, +cats, et al.), there‚Äôs literally nothing else. And those are just things to scroll past and look at; they don‚Äôt drive engagement or interaction. The top 10 on the trending page, as of this writing, is as follows: 1) Trump good, Biden bad 2) BLM bad 3) Trans bad 4) Disney bad 5) Reddit bad 6) Women bad, communism bad 7) Gays and blacks bad 8) Chauvin is innocent 9) Trans bad 10) Gays bad The 10 most recent threads are: 1) Black Superman bad 2) Bible verse 3) Blacks bad 4) Blacks bad 5) Blacks bad 6) Just a slur for blacks 7) ‚ÄúWhite BLM whores‚Äù is the title 8) Microsoft is trying to microchip everyone 9) Blacks bad, women bad 10) Blacks bad This is the sum of Ruqqus‚Äô content. It‚Äôs all it is all day, every day. There are a few guilds where someone stupidly thinks that posting anime or a woodworking video or something a few times a day will draw people to it, but it never works because no one cares. Trending (the page potential new users see before anything!) is routinely 100% just various -isms, often with completely fake screenshots of articles that don‚Äôt exist. Ruqqus users don‚Äôt care about accuracy, they don‚Äôt care about humor, they don‚Äôt care about anything. For a thread to succeed on Ruqqus, all it needs is vitriol. It doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs a completely fabricated screenshot, or an article from 20 years ago, or just a slur with nothing else. That‚Äôs what trends. There is nothing else on Ruqqus and no reason anyone would see the site and want to join. This is a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù somehow - Here‚Äôs a screenshot of a 2016 article about something that happened in 2009 - I just grabbed these off New; they‚Äôre not outliers. This is all Ruqqus is. The problem with Ruqqus is its userbase. No one there has any personality, any interests, any goals in life whatsoever. It‚Äôs nothing but relentless and exhausting interchangeable blind rage at minority groups. Full stop. Ruqqus needs basic community standards or this is all it will ever be. No one will check the site, see these things, and think ‚Äúwow, look at all that free speech, I sure want to join this place!‚Äù, they‚Äôll see it and recognize that since 100% of the content visible is overtly nazi content by self-identified nazis, that Ruqqus is a nazi site. And why would anyone who isn‚Äôt a nazi join a nazi site? The cycle perpetuates itself. Immediate course correction is a if Ruqqus hopes to survive when that Bitcoin runs out. must all 69 comments sorted by: best Want to add to the discussion? Post a comment! 6 points 7 points 8 points I just made a ruqqus account to check it out and I‚Äôm promptly leaving that shit hole of a site. Even posts that aren‚Äôt in any way about race always go back to the ‚Äúwhite good black bad‚Äù debacle. There‚Äôs whole subs dedicated to racism that blatantly have n****r in their titles. One post with an Asian woman in it had hordes of racist comments. I can‚Äôt even call it a Reddit alternative; it‚Äôs just a cesspool for racists, bigots, and neck beards to spew hate when they‚Äôre not jerking it to their waifus. Absolute scum of a site. [] 4 points 5 points They‚Äôre fun to post interracial couples and gifs of men kissing at sometimes ü•≤ -1 points 0 points 1 point I'm trying to recruit others in order to dilute all that stuff. They have a guild called +RuqqusPromotionSquad for just that. 2 points 3 points I appreciate your efforts but I highly doubt it‚Äôll help. They‚Äôll continue to spew hate under the guise of the ‚Äúfree speech‚Äù that ruqqus promotes. I‚Äôll probably give the site another go and try the niche guilds. I can see how ruqqus would definitely turn other potential users away due to the rampant bigotry all across the site. Another example of a good idea gone wrong unfortunately.

Another example of a good idea gone wrong unfortunately. I mean, free speech the point of Ruqqus, even if it's full of garbage. And any free-speech platform gets my support. is Reddit used to be that way too. It's just that Reddit used to have more than "the joos own everything", and for now Ruqqus does not. Well you are right. I love the idea of free speech, I just can‚Äôt stand that we‚Äôre given the option of a platform that supports free speech yet people are using it to spread hate. Here‚Äôs to hoping the shitty content gets overrun by better content. I agree, it really is sad that free speech isn't actually used for good over there. I'm hoping the devs were right when they say that the Vue update will attract more normies. For now I post stuff in +gaming, +open-source and +HistoryinPictures, there some of the best niche and non-political ones I know of. Actually most of them hate anime, they already ran off all the anime subs that had migrated there. Based Carp if it was someone other than Carp, maybe this thread would have been more true the name of the person speaking doesn't determine if something is true or false. you sound like a leftist. Oh I'm so not a leftist. Do a quick tour on Ruqqus. And search his name you'll see if it's the truth. i fail to see how posting gay porn (which is 100% legal speech) makes anything he says less or more true. No not that. I meant the fact that he is so "loved"(which he is not I believe) in the Ruqqus community. Come on, It's not hard to see why he made the thread. Some People's advice for newcomers on ruqqus is to block carp right away I aint kidding I meant the fact that he is so "loved"(which he is not I believe) in the Ruqqus community. He's loved by half the userbase and hated by the other half. So am I. Who cares? It's not hard to see why he made the thread. The original submission is true. would be no different if you posted it. Some People's advice for newcomers on ruqqus is to block carp right away So? They have the right to block whoever they want. [deleted] [removed] 15 points 16 points 17 points Problem is Ruqqus doesn't advertise itself as an alt-right platform it advertises itself as a place for everyone who wants to say things without being banned. Especially back last June during the mass Reddit ban waves when they had actual left wing and non-political communities there. Voat and Poal do a good job of being clear that they're geared toward right wing extremism and fed posting and as a result people who don't like them stay the hell away. That's why people aren't on here weekly complaining about them. Ruqqus tries to play all sides to get as many people as possible to join, then everyone feels betrayed when they either get fucked by the hive mind trying to destroy their guilds or fucked by the admins randomly banning them. Well in principle they are not banning leftists, but most leftists have no reason to leave Reddit as they are mostly allowed to continue on here. So majority of people who are seeking alternatives will be right wing. I don't see any problem with leftists who can't take the right wing posts leaving Ruqqus. Ruqqus should let the site's users fall wherever it lands (in terms of the political leaning). It's not like reddit identifies itself as an alt-left platform. fucked by the admins randomly banning them. Oh fuck off. The only people "randomly banned" by the ruqqus admins were people like JoesephGobbels or Klenvastergan who are anything except leftists. The truth lmao right platforms > alt right platforms "we luuuv freeze peaches" I'm alt right and I have no idea what this is. "agree with us or fuck off Isn't that like every political faction in 2021? frankly at this rate might as well abandon the ship, and use the source code for another community. Any site that is adheres to it's free speech principles is going to have right wing content. You can be pissed off about that or you can step back and think for a second about it. It's sad that we were given the gift of free speech, and all we could think to do with it was say slurs. Do you blame people who yell out a slur if they're called a nazi anyway for not being woke enough? True. Didnt you mod that last one carp? For an hour or so before cap fixed it and gave it back to Goebbels ;-; No, they obviously are. I don't know ruqqus, I was only replying to thzt one phrase -2 points So by that logic, black people can join gangs and shoot each other because society forced them into ghettos anyway? People who are treated unfairly will channel their frustrations somehow. I'm not saying it's right, I think this is just human nature. I'm not one of those 'abolish the police' kind of people, but the best wzy to prevent crime, is preventing poverty. "Ruqqus doesn't hire pedophiles" Are you sure about that? A VIP user and bug reporter was banned for linking people to a shortened url that ran a google search for cp. Months later after the outrage toward this user died down and people forgot about them they came back on an alt and reported a bug to the admin. As thanks for the service the admin un-banned their account. Would you consider a bug reporter "hired"? Guess they aren't getting paid but I don't see much difference if the admins endorse them. Keep in mind this is a site where they banned a user for joking about suing them and still refuse to un-ban the user even after numerous appeals and petitions have been made for them. 9 points 10 points Hi, I am the user in question. Most of this comment is true, but I want to comment on a few things. I am not a pedophile, and I am not sure whether captainmeta4 actually considered me to be one, considering that linking to a google search does not sexualize minors or lead to any actual cp. However, I will admit that I should not have posted it. I don't think I was a VIP user. I am not sure what it means. I did have Ruqqus premium, but I never paid for it. I copied the link from one of selplacei's posts which he got banned for. I wrote the expanded url in the post as well. Because URL shorteners are banned, the link was not actually a shortened link, but a google search link disguised as one like this: . It was actually less than a month later. "Months later" I agree that captainmeta4 should have acted differently. He should have either kept me banned or said the ban was wrong as well as unbanning other wrongfully banned users (I prefer the latter). Then it won't seem like he's endorsing someone he thought of as a "pedophile". If you feel like trying to explain how it's okay to revert a ban for "sexualizing minors" due to site contributions feel free to do so. Otherwise I assume you realize there's no good excuse. I'll start for you "We have zero tolerance! Except when ......." Xigbar? I heard you got banned from Poal for being a pedo lmao I'm not xigbar lol. Readers should be aware that this is a post by someone who was universally Loathed by almost every user on Ruqqus, and they were banned. Sour grapes, much? Second, there is plenty of non-racist, non-Nazi content on Ruqqus. There are a ton of leftists, Democrats, and yes, even Communists who often, without censorship, tell everyone else to F-off and argue with them. The only difference is, they are allowed to argue, and hold a differing opinion---which you are NOT allowed in some, unnamed, other places we all know the name of even as we post on it. But the most excellent point about the site is that I can, and did, Block this user from my feed. You can block any individual user, or any thread, from showing up on your feed. That is an option that doesn't exist elsewhere, that I know of. Don't want to see Nazi content? Then block it yourself. But that's Your choice, Your freedom, not dictated by some power-mod somewhere in a basement who thinks you're too stupid to make that decision like an adult so they have to make it for you, to protect you from yourself, like a you're a child. Either way, Ruqqus is still a billion and one times better than some other sites who openly promote, hire, and protect pedophiles and censor everything you say, even the mildest dissent. I'd rather come across the occasional Nazi and racist and have the option to block them, than to have my every word censored because I don't one-hundred percent tow an imaginary, arbitrary "social justice fake woke" morality pushed by the immoral majority to the T-and Dotted-I. Ban me, do not care. I think I've used this site and user profile once in like 2 Years? Reddit is dead. Long live free speech and Freedom of choice. 11 points 12 points 13 points I think he was loathed because he had special privileges to harass people and get away with it, and he would regularly spam gay porn in the comments of random posts, moreso than political differences. But I don't speak for everyone. Lies start in line 1. I‚Äôm 1) not banned and never have been banned, and 2) the most subscribed user on the garbage platform. And the lies only continue from there. You‚Äôre seriously pretending there‚Äôs some sort of not only leftist, but neoliberal and communist presence on Ruqqus. This is amazing. You were banned dude, one of my top posts is a screenshot of your ban message An automatic (and overturned) 1-day suspension from spam != banned So what? I've been banned too? And so was TV1. It was an automatic suspension carried out by the ruqqus system, carp didn't do anything that required manual admin intervention. (dio btw) It seems like a bunch of edgelord kids there like /pol/ on 4chan. The way for fast rep is post right wing talking points and stuff like your examples.,, say anything other than their "narrative" and they whine like hell. They will need to be able to self-host or die if they stay the current course. Eh, and the exact reverse applies to Reddit. Your point? Oh right, one side is "muh hate". Would you have a problem if Reddit trends "White people bad"? If so, congrats, you don't have double standards. Now understand that if one of them is allowed to exist, the other should also. Sure, you can throw all your "they are edgelords" comments all you want. They will call you a cu*k or whatever. All should be fair game if you have a ounce of decency. RIP @milkit he's still around, lol As opposed to 1) white man bad 2)funko pop good 3)Cape shit 4)Biden = cool uncle 4)Black people worship 5) you go girl! 6)check out the latest thing I shoved up my ass Well this is what happens when Reddit turns into a liberal echo chamber. Like minded people get bullied off the app and then you get extreme leaning people who go in and ruin what people were trying to start. not to mention they banned my man @JosephGoebbels On the one hand, JG absolutely did not deserve to be banned for the reason given. On the other, he did get away with posting photos of children‚Äôs penises under the guise of it being ‚Äúmedical gore,‚Äù so this isn‚Äôt a hill I‚Äôm willing to die on. didn't know about that, pretty cringe ngl On the other, he did get away with posting photos of children‚Äôs penises under the guise of it being ‚Äúmedical gore,‚Äù I haven't seen the pictures, but were they genital mutilation (aka circumcision) photos? Because the fact that that is still legal is a legitimate issue. Posting pictures of it might not be the best advocacy but it's a legitimate reason. Whatever. "community standards" = censorship. Ever see a monkey cover it's eyes? Try doing that, and it will all go away. Then stay on Reddit then. I agree with most of the top 10, especially BLM bad, FUCK BLM. lol butthurt carp is butthurt Cringe carp So, basically, if you had your way, you'd take the socially dynamic, healthy and vibrant social platform, Ruqqus, and turn it into the socially and politically repressed and censored shit hole that is Reddit and turn it into Reddit 2.0? Yeah, I don't think you thought this through very well. For funsies, here's the ruqqus thread discussing your whinepost: be the change you want to see I accidentally posted in a sub that banned me in 2019. It was a 3-day suspension, then it got upgraded to a permanent one for no reason. You are quite right. The site is full of garbage with some useful information between here and there. But why is that? You find there all the stuff that gets you banned here or at least downvoted to oblivion. It is full of it. Of course you can say now that all they do is posting racist garbage. But that is not the full truth. Not ALL users are like this. This is an unfair conclusion. Some are desperately searching for a place without heavily biased moderation. There are people that could use Reddit and not have problems 99% of the time by current standards. But that one take they have on a specific topic will get them banned here on Reddit. So they look for other sites and find Ruqqus where they could say it. But then again Ruqqus is full of other shit that disgusts those people too. When I see the main page of ruqqus my brain hurts. It is not inviting. There could be other good stuff too but that is mostly concentrated on Reddit. This is a never ending dilemma where people find nothing that allows free speech without being full blown racist and right wing. ‚Äã Meanwhile Reddit allows and bans the rest ü§°ü§°ü§° Ruqqus needs less political communities and more diverse content, alongside with people with different views, hobbies, etc. The only reason why I'm on Ruqqus is because my subreddit was attacked by AHS a year ago (Can't believe it's already been a year) and some people suggested we have a backup there. Overall, I can see why there is content with similar view points (because Reddit decides to mostly ban one side instead of the other). However, I do also think that Ruqqus must open up to new views, topics, ideas, hobbies, whatever. And I can also see why there would be extremist on there. No one with a half a brain likes an extremist no matter what side. If you want to start a website with free speech, take my advice. This is probably a good counter at the moment. Do something new and do not advertise yourself as a alternative. Honestly, I'm sick and tired of the diversion and the censorship. Why can't we just get along and agree to disagree? Why do right-wing alternative sites usually end up falling to shit?
