Fair Use Policy. Calendly’s Fair Use Policy builds on existing use restrictions and helps us ensure that the services can be used fairly by every customer. Certain Calendly features, like notifications, may be aggregated and collectively sent from fewer email addresses or phone numbers. This means those features are used concurrently by a number of customers. If a single customer places disproportionately high demands on the services, it may adversely affect the Calendly experience for other users. The vast majority of our customers use the service considerately and their usage levels don't adversely impact service capacity. However, even the activity of a small number of customers who use the service inappropriately has the potential to significantly impact the service for other customers. limitations Beta Features. https://calendly.com/terms/beta-terms Indemnification.You alone are responsible for any violation of these Terms by you.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration; Class Action Waiver. Please Read This Provision Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights. This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute that may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. This provision provides that all disputes between you and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer this because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation. To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). YOU AND CALENDLY AGREE THAT ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION. Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution Arbitration Procedures https://jamsadr.com/ Class Action Waiver Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Calendly specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Other You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause within this provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be decided by a court. This provision will survive the termination of your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a dispute between us arises.
