When you interact with our Services, open email we send you, or visit a third-party website for which we provide Services, we and our partners use cookies and other tracking technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons, and widgets (collectively, “Cookies”) to recognize you as a user, customize your online experiences and online content, including to serve you interest-based advertising, perform analytics; mitigate risk and prevent potential fraud, and promote trust and safety across our Services. We use Cookies to collect your device information, internet activity information, and inferences as described above. You can disable or decline some cookies for our Services. But, since some parts of our service rely on cookies to work, those services could become difficult or impossible to use. Some web browsers have an optional setting called “Do Not Track” (DNT) that lets you opt-out of being tracked by advertisers and some third parties. Because many of our services won’t function without tracking data, we do not respond to DNT settings. Your rights to access, correction, deletion, and restriction to use or share your Personal Information. Under applicable data protection law, you have certain rights to how your Personal Information is collected, stored, used and shared. We recognize the importance of your ability to control the use of your Personal Information and provide several ways for you to exercise your rights to access (right to know), correction, deletion (erasure), and to restrict certain information (right to opt out of sharing and right to limit use and disclosure of sensitive personal information). How do you exercise your rights? If you or an authorized agent submit a request, we’ll first need to verify who you are before we can respond to your request. We may ask you to provide us with information necessary to reasonably verify your identity before responding to your request. We will compare the information you submit against our internal business records to verify your identity. If we can’t verify your identity, we will not be able to fulfill your request. If we deny your request in whole or in part, you may have the right to appeal the decision. In such circumstances, we will provide you with information regarding the appeals process. Your right to request a copy of the Personal Information. If you want to make a request to know about the data we’ve collected about you in the past 12 months, you have choices: Your right to correct your Personal Information: Your right to delete your Personal Information: Understanding your choices You can control how Personal Information is collected or disclosed, as well as how we communicate with you. Here are some of the ways you can customize your choices. Choose how we collect Personal Information You may choose to limit the Personal Information you provide when our apps or Services request it. To help make choices that are right for you, it’s important to understand that Personal Information helps us provide a richer, more personalized experience for you. Also, some Personal Information is required for our Services to function at all. For example, sharing your contacts helps make it easier for you to find the people you want to send money to. If you choose not to share your contacts with us, you can still use our mobile apps, but some actions may not be as fast or easy as it would be if shared your contacts. Another example is creating an account or Connect profile with us. If you choose not to provide information that is required for an account or Connect profile to function, like your name and email address, we will not be able to create an account or Connect profile for you. Choose how linked accounts collect and use Personal Information If you link your account to a third-party service, you may be able to manage how your Personal Information is collected, used, and shared by them. Read the third parties’ privacy policies to see the choices they offer you. You can control which third-party services you link to your account and what Personal Information they can collect about you. For example, to manage the permissions, go to the Security settings in your PayPal account. Choose what we disclose with other Users Some Personal Information may be seen by other Users. You may be able to adjust or turn off this setting in the privacy section in your account settings. Choose how we communicate with you Your choices about how we communicate with you differ depending on the purpose of the message and how it is delivered. Some messages are considered optional, and some are necessary for you to manage your accounts or Connect profile with us. We use email, text messages, push notifications on your mobile device, and even phone calls or paper mail depending on the situation and your preferences. You can click the unsubscribe link in a PayPal or Connect marketing email, opt out of a text message by replying “STOP,” or turn off notifications on your device.
