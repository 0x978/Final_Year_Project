ARBITRATION AGREEMENT CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER If you are an individual and you access or use Airtable on behalf of a company, organization, principal, or other entity, such as your employer (each, together with its affiliates, an "Organization"), then: (i) these Terms of Service are an agreement between us and you and us and that Organization; (ii) you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that Organization to these Terms (and if you do not have the authority, you may not access or use Airtable); (iii) your acceptance of these Terms will bind such Organization to these Terms; (iv) your individual right to access and use Airtable may be suspended or terminated (and ownership and administration of your Airtable Account may be transferred) if you cease to be associated with, or cease to use an email address associated with, owned by, or provisioned by, that Organization; (v) we may disclose information regarding you and your use of the Service, including Your Content (defined below), to such Organization, or to appropriate individuals associated with that Organization; and (vi) the terms “you” and “your”, as used in these Terms, refer to both you and such Organization. If you sign up for Airtable using an email address associated with, owned by, or provisioned by an Organization, or if an Organization pays fees due in connection with your access to or use of Airtable (or reimburses you for payment of such fees), or otherwise, then we may deem you, in our sole discretion, to be accessing and using Airtable on behalf of that Organization. You represent and warrant that all information that you provide to us regarding any Organization on whose behalf you use Airtable, including information identifying other users associated with such Organization or email domains owned by such Organization, is and at all times will be truthful, accurate, and complete, and that you will immediately notify us should any such information change or no longer be truthful, accurate, or complete. Organization You may use Airtable only if you can form a legally binding contract with us (and on behalf of your Organization as applicable), and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations.

If you are a parent or legal guardian of an Airtable user who is unable to form a binding contract under applicable law, you are agreeing to these Terms and you are responsible for such Airtable user’s activity on Airtable. Airtable is not available to any users who were previously removed from the Service. Your account on Airtable (your "Airtable Account") gives you access to the services and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time. We may maintain different types of Airtable Accounts for different types of users. You acknowledge and agree that you do not own your Airtable Account. Airtable Account You may not use another user’s Airtable Account without such user’s permission. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Airtable Account, and you must keep your Airtable Account password(s) strong and secure. You should notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Airtable Account. Any individual with administrator-level access to your Airtable Account can modify your Airtable Account settings, access and billing information. We will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your Airtable Account, or for any changes to your Airtable Account, including your ability to access your Airtable Account or Your Content (defined below), made by any individual with administrator-level access to your Airtable Account. Your Content You (on behalf of yourself and your Organization, if applicable, and your other licensors) grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, us an irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), fully paid, royalty-free, and worldwide right and license to use, copy, store, modify, and display Your Content: (i) to provide, maintain, improve, and optimize use of Airtable; (ii) to perform such other actions as authorized by you in connection with your use of Airtable; and (iii) for any other purpose consistent with the Privacy Policy. If you are an individual using Airtable on behalf of an Organization and are collaborating with other employees or other individuals who have access to Your Content under your Airtable Account, or if you share Your Content with other individuals within or outside of such Organization, the content on your Airtable Account that you make available to such other individuals (as well as other information, such as the names and contact information of other individuals who have access to your workspace(s) or Your Content within Airtable) will be visible, accessible, and, depending on their designated level of access, editable by such individuals. You can remove Your Content from your Airtable Account by deleting it. However, in certain instances, some of Your Content may not be completely removed. We are not responsible or liable for the removal or deletion of any of Your Content, or any failure to remove or delete such content. In connection with Your Content, you represent and warrant that: (i) you have all necessary rights, licenses, and consents to provide, receive, access, and/or use Your Content and any other content you provide, receive, access, and/or use through or in connection with Airtable; and (ii) Your Content and our use thereof as contemplated by these Terms and our Service will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including any intellectual property rights and privacy rights. We take no responsibility and assume no liability for Your Content. You shall be solely responsible for Your Content and the consequences of posting it, publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on Airtable. You shall be solely responsible and indemnify us for Your Content. To the extent you receive our Software, subject to your compliance with these Terms, during the applicable Subscription Term, we grant to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable right and license to use our Software solely as reasonably necessary for your use of Airtable in accordance with these Terms. You may cancel your Airtable Account at any time through your Account Settings page, though we will be sorry to see you go. We may change Airtable, stop providing Airtable or features of Airtable to you or to our users generally, or create usage limits for Airtable. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to Airtable without notice or liability, without cause or for any reason, including if in our sole discretion you violate any provision of these Terms. Upon termination, you continue to be bound by these Terms. In our sole discretion, we may make available to you certain product features on a trial basis, and such trial may be designated by us as an alpha, a beta, a pilot, a limited release, a test period, a developer preview, or an evaluation, or using another similar term (“Product Trial”). You may participate in any Product Trial, subject to these Terms and any additional terms and conditions made available by us. You acknowledge that product features made available to you as part of a Product Trial (“Trial Features”) might contain bugs, errors, or omissions. Trial Features are provided to you for testing purposes only, on an “AS IS” basis, without any warranty, liability, indemnity, or performance obligations. Trial Features are not subject to any service level agreements or support commitments. Trial Features might never be made available for general use or otherwise be provided in a future version of our Service, and we may discontinue Trial Features, or revoke your access to Trial Features, at any time for any or no reason, in our sole discretion, without any liability to you. Discontinuing Trial Features, or making Trial Features inaccessible to you, may have the effect of making some or all of Your Content inaccessible to you. Product Trial Trial Features You acknowledge and agree that Airtable and all materials and content displayed or made available on Airtable, and all software, algorithms, code, technology, and intellectual property underlying and included in or with Airtable, and all intellectual property rights therein and thereto throughout the world (collectively and individually, our "Intellectual Property"), are our (or our licensors’ as applicable) sole and exclusive property. Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to create a license in or under any intellectual property rights, and you agree not to access, sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, or create derivative works from any of our Intellectual Property. Intellectual Property You may choose to, or we may invite you to, submit comments, feedback, or ideas about Airtable, including about how to improve our Service ("Feedback"). You agree that Airtable will own any such Feedback, and that we are free to use the Feedback without any additional compensation to you, and to disclose the Feedback on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You acknowledge that, by accepting your submission of Feedback, we do not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to us, or developed by our employees, or obtained from sources other than you. Feedback Applications Airtable Marketplace You are solely responsible for all maintenance and support for your Applications, and you will ensure that your Applications comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including applicable privacy, data security, advertising, and marketing laws and regulations, and with all technical and compatibility requirements provided in our documentation. We disclaim all responsibility and liability related to your Applications. You must make any use of your Applications by third parties (including other Airtable users) subject to a privacy policy that is conspicuously-posted within your Applications. Your Application’s privacy policy, and any terms and conditions governing your Application, must comply with applicable law and accurately and plainly describe your and our collection, use, storage, and sharing of such users’ personal and confidential data in connection with your Applications and our Service. For clarity, you will retain ownership of your Applications, subject to our rights in our APIs and our Service. We reserve the right to audit your Applications to determine whether they violate these Terms. We may offer plans that you may sign up for that allow you to use certain aspects of Airtable, either for free or for a fee (a "Subscription Plan"). We may change Subscription Plans, including by offering new services or features for additional fees and charges or by adding or amending fees and charges for existing Subscription Plans, in our sole discretion. Any change to a Subscription Plan’s pricing or payment terms will become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in these Terms. Subscription Plans may set allotments for use of designated Service aspects. Use of Service aspects in excess of a Subscription Plan’s designated allotment may result in (additional) fees, and such fees will be included in a true-up invoice or charged automatically via the payment method associated with your Airtable Account ("Payment Method"). Subscription Plan Payment Method Subscription Term Your subscription continues until canceled by you or we terminate your access to or use of Airtable in accordance with these Terms. Unless and until canceled by you, all Subscription Plans will automatically renew for renewal terms equal in length to the original Subscription Term. If you do not want a Subscription Plan to renew, you must cancel it before the end of the Subscription Term via the account settings page on your Airtable Account). If you purchase a Subscription Plan, we (or our third-party payment processor) will automatically charge you each year or month, as applicable, on the anniversary of the commencement of your subscription, using the payment information you have provided, until you cancel your subscription. By agreeing to these Terms and electing to purchase a Subscription Plan, you acknowledge that your Subscription Plan has recurring payment features and you accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of your subscription by you or us. If we cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, except in the event of your breach or failure to pay fees when due, we will grant you a prorated refund for the remaining unused portion of your Subscription Term. If you cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, your right to use Airtable will continue until the end of your then-current Subscription Term and then terminate without further charges. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you live in the European Union or Turkey and cancel your Subscription Plan within fourteen (14) days of purchase, you will be eligible for a refund of any payments made for the canceled Subscription Term, and, if you request such a refund, your right to use Airtable will terminate immediately upon cancellation of your subscription. Subject to the preceding sentence, if you cancel or terminate your Subscription Plan, unless required by law, YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OF ANY PORTION OF ANY FEES PAID FOR THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM AT THE TIME OF CANCELLATION. Any late payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less (plus the costs of collection). Any credits that may accrue to your Airtable Account (for example, as a result of a promotion or referral program, or a Subscription Plan downgrade) will expire one year following their accrual, or upon expiration or termination of your Airtable Account, whichever is earlier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any credits accrued to a workspace on a free Subscription Plan will expire if the workspace’s Subscription Plan is not upgraded to a paid Subscription Plan within ninety (90) days of accrual, unless otherwise specified. Credits have no currency or exchange value, and are not transferable or refundable. We may make available software to access our Service via a compatible mobile device ("Mobile Applications"). You may incur mobile data charges from your wireless provider in connection with the Mobile Applications, and you agree that you are solely responsible for any such charges. We grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile Applications for your Airtable Account on one or more mobile devices owned or leased solely by you, solely in accordance with these Terms. You acknowledge that we may from time to time issue upgraded versions of the Mobile Applications, and may automatically electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Applications that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that these Terms will apply to all such upgrades. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Applications is covered by the applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Applications or any copy thereof. We or our third-party partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Applications (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties, or obligations hereunder, except as expressly provided for in these Terms, is void. Mobile Applications If you acquire any Mobile Applications from any third-party app store, such as the Apple App Store: (i) you acknowledge that these Terms are between you and us only, and not with such third party; (ii) your use of such Mobile Applications must comply with such third party’s then-current app store terms and conditions; (iii) such third party is only a provider of the app store where you obtained such Mobile Applications; (iv) we, and not such third party, are solely responsible for our Mobile Applications; (v) such third party has no obligation or liability to you with respect to such Mobile Applications or these Terms; and (vi) you acknowledge and agree that such third party is a third-party beneficiary to these Terms as it relates to such Mobile Applications.

Airtable recommends that all users implement 2FA for their use of Airtable.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WE OR OUR AFFILIATES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS (OR OUR OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, AGENTS, OFFICERS OR DIRECTORS) BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, OUR SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF OUR SERVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVICE; (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SECURE SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM OUR SERVICE; (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH OUR SERVICE BY ANY THIRD PARTY; (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH OUR SERVICE; AND/OR (VII) YOUR DATA OR THE DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE, OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. THIS AGREEMENT GIVES YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM STATE TO STATE. THE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. From time to time, either party to these Terms (the "Disclosing Party") may disclose or make available to the other (the "Receiving Party") non-public, proprietary, or confidential information of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”). Confidential Information includes any information that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including non-public business, product, technology and marketing information. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of the Receiving Party's breach of this Section 13; (ii) is or becomes available to the Receiving Party on a non-confidential basis from a third-party source, provided that such third party is not and was not prohibited from disclosing such Confidential Information; (iii) was in the Receiving Party's possession prior to the Disclosing Party's disclosure thereof; or (iv) was or is independently developed by the Receiving Party without using any of the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. "Disclosing Party" "Receiving Party" “Confidential Information” If the Receiving Party is required by applicable law or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall, prior to making such disclosure, use commercially-reasonable efforts to notify the Disclosing Party of such requirements to afford the Disclosing Party the opportunity to seek, at the Disclosing Party's sole cost and expense, a protective order or other remedy. Each of the parties to these Terms acknowledges that the other party will be irreparably harmed if Confidential Information of the other is distributed in breach of this Section, and that such other party would not have an adequate remedy at law in the event of such an actual or threatened breach. Therefore, each of the parties agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief against any actual or threatened breaches of this Section by the other party without the necessity of showing actual damages or showing that monetary damages would not afford an adequate remedy. You agree that: (i) we will be deemed solely domiciled in the State of California; and (ii) our Service will be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over us, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. These Terms will be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that these Terms evidence a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) ( “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of the Arbitration Agreement in Section 14.2 and preempts all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA is determined not to apply to any issue that arises from or relates to the Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under and governed by the law of your state of residence. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in San Francisco, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration Agreement below, including any provisional relief required to prevent irreparable harm. You agree that San Francisco, California is the proper and exclusive forum for any appeals of an arbitration award or for trial court proceedings in the event that the arbitration provision below is found to be unenforceable. FAA READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. This section 14.2 (the “Arbitration Agreement”) applies to and governs any dispute, controversy, or claim between you and us that arises out of or relates to, directly or indirectly: (a) these Terms, including the formation, existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, validity, or enforceability thereof; (b) access to or use of our Service, including receipt of any advertising, marketing, or other communications from us; (c) any transactions through, by, or using our Service; or (d) any other aspect of your relationship or transactions with us, directly or indirectly, as a user or consumer (“Claim” or collectively, “Claims”). The Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all Claims that arose or were asserted before or after your consent to these Terms. READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US. Arbitration Agreement Claim Claims Rules NOTHING IN THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED AS PREVENTING US FROM SEEKING INJUNCTIVE OR OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF FROM THE COURTS AS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THE ACTUAL OR THREATENED INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, OR VIOLATION OF OUR DATA SECURITY, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR OTHER PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; OR PREVENTING YOU FROM ASSERTING CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT, IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY AND SO LONG AS THE MATTER REMAINS IN SUCH COURT AND ADVANCES ON ONLY AN INDIVIDUAL (NON-CLASS, NON-COLLECTIVE, AND NON-REPRESENTATIVE) BASIS. IF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL BE SEVERED. SEVERANCE OF THE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL PROVISION, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SHALL HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH SHALL REMAIN IN FORCE, OR THE PARTIES’ ABILITY TO COMPEL ARBITRATION OF ANY REMAINING CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS PURSUANT TO THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF THE CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER IS FOUND TO BE VOID, UNENFORCEABLE, OR UNLAWFUL, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BECAUSE IT WOULD PREVENT YOU FROM SEEKING PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, THEN ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO SUCH RELIEF (AND ONLY THAT RELIEF) MUST BE SEVERED FROM ARBITRATION AND MAY BE LITIGATED IN A CIVIL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION. ALL OTHER CLAIMS FOR RELIEF SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SHALL BE ARBITRATED UNDER ITS TERMS, AND THE PARTIES AGREE THAT LITIGATION OF ANY DISPUTE REGARDING THE ENTITLEMENT TO PUBLIC INJUNCTIVE RELIEF SHALL BE STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF ANY INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS IN ARBITRATION. WITH RESPECT TO ALL PERSONS AND ENTITIES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY HAVE OBTAINED OR USED OUR SERVICE FOR PERSONAL, COMMERCIAL OR OTHER PURPOSES, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF ONLY TO AN INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANT AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF ON INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED MAY NOT AFFECT OTHER USERS.
