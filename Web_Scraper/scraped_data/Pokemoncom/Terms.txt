This Service may refer to contests, sweepstakes or similar events (including without limitation Play! Pokémon Program championship events) that offer prizes or require you to send in material or information about yourself. Each contest, sweepstakes or other such event has its own rules, which you must read and agree to before you may enter. 9. PLAY! POKÉMON PROGRAM. Because of the popularity of the Pokémon products, a large number of real-world Pokémon trading-card and videogame tournaments ("Play! Pokémon Events") may be occurring worldwide on any given day. While we do organize certain special events and championship events, most Play! Pokémon Events are organized or operated by independent third-party organizers, such as retailers of trading card games. While most Play! Pokémon Events are not run by us, we do post to the Service certain information we receive about Play! Pokémon Events from independent Play! Pokémon Event organizers. Such information includes event schedules and locations, and the names and rankings of PTC Account-holders who have selected the option in their Play! Pokémon settings to have this information posted to the Service. Information received from these independent. Play! Pokémon Event organizers allows us to create and post player rankings based on tournament results. Pokémon will use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date information on the Service, but Pokémon makes no representations or warranties of any kind about its accuracy, currency or completeness of information on the Service, including without limitation, tournament results and player ranking. 11. VIRTUAL CONTENT. We may, at various times, permit you to use "real world" money to buy Virtual Content. "Virtual Content" is a generic term for the products and services available to users free of charge, via code card redemption, or for purchase within the Service which may be used within the Service to access certain features, functions, and other Virtual Content. Virtual Content includes but is not limited to, virtual items like digital trading cards; deck sleeves; and coins; as well as in-Service Virtual Currency like Crystals and Credits ("Virtual Currency"). Certain features in the Services may be unavailable if not purchased. We may, from time to time, and at our sole discretion, provide opportunities for users to acquire certain Virtual Content free of charge, at reduced rates, or as bonus content when you acquire other Virtual Content or real world content such as certain physical Pokémon Trading Card products. You may only acquire Virtual Content in the amount and at times permitted by us in our sole discretion and may only purchase Virtual Content for your personal use within the Service. The inclusion of any Virtual Content at a particular time does not imply or warrant that the same Virtual Content will be available at any or all times. All features, content, capabilities, and specifications of Virtual Content described or depicted in the Service are subject to change at any time without notice. Virtual Content does not have monetary value, and may not be redeemed for legal currency, services, or items of value outside of the Services. Virtual Content obtained via the Service is provided to you under a limited, personal, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable license to use within the Service. You have no property interest; right or title in or to any Virtual Content appearing or originating in the service, and Virtual Content may not be transferred or resold in any manner not explicitly permitted by us. We may terminate your license to Virtual Content at any time and at our sole discretion. 12. PURCHASING VIRTUAL CONTENT. For all charges for any Virtual Content sold on the Service, we, or payment processor acting on our behalf, will bill your credit card or alternative payment method. All prices for Virtual Content are displayed excluding taxes. You agree to pay all fees and applicable taxes incurred by you or anyone using an account registered to you. In the event that your credit card or alternative payment provider refuses to pay us for an amount credited to your account, we will have the right to delete the Virtual Content or the products or services purchased with such Virtual Content from your account. You agree that you will not cancel or reverse any charges for such Virtual Content or otherwise attempt to defraud us. In the event legal action is necessary to collect on balances due, you agree to reimburse us for all expenses incurred to recover sums due, including attorneys' fees and other legal expenses. ALL PURCHASES OF VIRTUAL CONTENT ARE NON-RETURNABLE AND NON-REFUNDABLE. If you redeem Virtual Currency to purchase in-game virtual items, you lose any statutory right of withdrawal because we begin performing our services upon your redemption of Virtual Currency for Virtual Content. If through some problem with your account or any other reason you lose Virtual Content and we can verify that you had it, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to replace them. YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR UNUSED VIRTUAL CONTENT WHEN AN ACCOUNT IS CLOSED, WHETHER SUCH CLOSURE WAS VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY. Certain jurisdictions may provide additional statutory rights, including a Cooling-Off Period which allows you to withdraw from a purchase. Nothing herein is meant to limit your return or cancellation rights for your purchase of Virtual Content under local law. 13. UPDATES AND CHANGES TO THE SERVICE. We may, from time to time, issue patches or updates for portions of the Service which must be installed to continue using those portions of the Service. You consent to receive and install those patches and updates in order to continue using the Service. You also accept that all or portions of the Service may experience server issues that make it temporarily unavailable, and that we may in our sole discretion and without notice terminate all or any part of the Service. You accept that you will have no recourse of any kind against us even if this causes you to lose a match, to lose Virtual Content, or to have no further access to all or part of the Service. 14. DISCLAIMER. THE SERVICE AND ALL CONTENT THEREIN ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO POKÉMON'S NEGLIGENCE, WILL POKÉMON OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LICENSORS, LICENSEES, OFFICERS AND/OR AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, DIRECT, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES RELATED TO (A) THE USE OF, (B) THE INABILITY TO USE, OR (C) ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE CONTENTS AND FUNCTIONS OF THIS SERVICE, EVEN IF POKÉMON OR AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE THEREOF HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT WILL THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF POKÉMON AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, INFORMATION PROVIDERS, LICENSORS, LICENSEES, OFFICERS AND/OR AFFILIATES TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT) EXCEED $100.00. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS LISTED ABOVE ARE A CONDITION OF US MAKING THE SERVICE AVAILABLE TO YOU. WITHOUT THEM, WE WOULD NOT AND COULD NOT MAKE THE SERVICES AVAILABLE. You accept that if we discover that you have violated any portion of these Terms, we may take any step we deem appropriate including but not limited to terminating your PTC Account and access to the Services. You acknowledge that if that happens, you will not receive any reimbursement or other compensation for any items that may be associated with your account at the time of termination. 15. INDEMNIFICATION. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Pokémon and its affiliates and their respective agents, directors, employees, information providers, licensors, licensees, officers and/or affiliates (collectively, "Indemnified Parties"), harmless from and against any and all liability and costs (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and costs), incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection with any claim arising out of any breach by you of these Terms or the foregoing representations, warranties, and covenants. You will cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the defense of any claim. Pokémon reserves the right, at its own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you and you will not in any event settle any matter without the written consent of Pokémon. 16.
