Thiago Melo What I most love in cryptpad it's about privacy policies and cryptography. Have a service of this category for free, it's just amazing. The teams and real time working kicks out any disappointing if compare the product with Google Docs. I really would trust CryptPad for any service or doc that you must do online and would not worry at all with information leaks. Thiago Melo It's realy easy and fast to setup a collaborative document.
