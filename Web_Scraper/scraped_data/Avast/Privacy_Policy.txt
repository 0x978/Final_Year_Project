Additional information on our personal data practices may be provided in product settings, contractual terms, or notices provided prior to or at the time of data collection. Please refer to our Products Policy describing specifics of personal data processing within our products and services. This Privacy Policy is intended for you if you are a user of our products and services. If you are a business partner, the privacy notice that applies to you is located here: Business partner policy. Personal Data We Process Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual person (“Personal Data”). We may collect data or ask you to provide certain data when you visit our websites, and use our products and services. The sources from which we collect Personal Data include: Data collected directly from you or your device relating to an identified or identifiable individual (“Data Subject”), and may include direct identifiers such as name, postal and email address, phone number, and online or indirect identifiers such as login account, login password, marketing preferences, social media account, and/or IP address; If we link other data with your Personal Data, we will treat that linked data as Personal Data; and We may also collect Personal Data from trusted third-party sources such as distributors, resellers, app stores, contact centers, and engage third parties such as marketing, survey, analytics or software suppliers to collect Personal Data to assist us. We do not process special categories of personal data, such as data concerning health, race, ethnicity or political opinions, or deduce in any way this type of information from data, we collect within our products. We organize the Personal Data we process into these basic categories: Billing Data, Account Data, and Product Data. Billing DataThe below described billing process applies to all customers who have purchased products and/or standalone features through our Gen eStore. This information is used to bill those customers for their services and products. Our parent company, Gen Digital Inc., will act as a controller with respect to processing of the Billing Data and will provide its own privacy policy to the relevant customers at the moment of purchase of the relevant products and services. Billing Data includes your name, email address, billing address, your phone number, payment information (depending on method can include Credit/Debit Card Information or PayPal account) and device fingerprint ID. Billing data What we use it for Email address To send you purchase receipts Name and Billing address To maintain billing records Payment information – payment card info, for businesses only VAT/Tax ID and Business ID To process the payment and billing records Identifiers – product and license keys/numbers, Wallet ID, Auto bill ID, Payment transaction ID To identify the product and enable features based on the purchased license and to track account activity between internal company systems, applications, and architecture. This data is also processed for the purpose of delivering the product in accordance with your device(s) as well as for trade compliance and fraud check. Renewability To check if a given subscription can be renewed under the same or similar terms Expiration date To check whether a license is current Device fingerprint ID To validate that an authenticated payment transaction occurred, and the payment card and account are appropriate for billing. In certain cases, you purchase our products and services from a trusted third-party service provider, reseller, or app store. In those circumstances, your Billing Data is processed by the relevant third party and we only receive a subset of this data to keep proper business records. In particular, we only have a masked credit/debit card number, not your full payment details. Account Data includes information to set up and customize an account, such as your name, email address and username, and information connected with our services, such as product, license and device information. For some of our products or some of their functions creating an account is necessary. Account Data is also used for customer management and engagement, revenue generation, and evaluation and optimization of operational, sales and business processes.See below an example of Account Data and what we use it for: Account data What we use it for Name To customize our communications by addressing you by your name Email address To send you communications regarding your license and support and to offer our other products and services Username To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service Account usage data (events such as request to end subscription, subscription-related information) To enable premium features activation, provide tailored life-cycle experience and communication with customer support, suitable product interface content. Subscription renewal date To help us validate the period the license is active Trial User To add a grace period prior to the paid period of the subscription An account is also necessary for some features of our Forum. In the Forum, you have the option to provide additional information within your account such as personal texts, disclose your birth date, identify your gender, instant messaging number, messenger username, or website name and address, disclose your physical location, and select an avatar or personalized picture. To register with us or to be able to log in later on our pages or in our products, we offer you, in addition to our own procedure, the option to do this via the services Facebook Connect, Google, and Apple ID. For this purpose, we will redirect you to a page of the corresponding provider. Data from the provider (email, platform ID, optionally name) is then provided to create the account. The customer account remains valid until you actively delete it in the user administration section of the account. You can also contact our support or DPO in case you would like to delete your account. Product Data includes two sub-categories: Device Data includes information about the operating system; hardware; city/country location of device; IP address, device error logs; browser; network; applications running on the device, including the Avast products; and Service Data includes information about product usage and events relating to use of our product by you. This information includes samples, detection details, and files used for malware protection, information concerning URLs of websites, usage statistics (activation, crashes, scans, errors). These sub-categories differ for each product and service. If you want more detail about Device and Service Data we process on a product basis, please refer to our Products Policy. Why We Process Your Personal Data We use your Personal Data for the following purposes and on the following grounds: On the basis of fulfilling our contract with you or entering into a contract with you on your request, in order to: To process purchase of our products or services from us, our partners or our trusted third- party service providers’ online stores and to bill for products and features purchased; To provision the download, activation, and performance of the product or service; To keep our products or services up-to-date, safe and free of errors, including implementation of new product features and versions; To verify your identity and entitlement to paid products or services, when you contact us for support or access our services; To process your purchase transactions; To update you on the status of your orders and licences; To manage your subscriptions and user accounts; and To provide you with technical and customer support.

On the basis of your consent, in order to: To subscribe you to a newsletter or the Avast forum; To enable the provision of third-party ads in product messages; To enable the provision of personalized ads in support of certain free products; and To allow us to record our phone conversation when you contact our tech support by phone. We will always ask for your consent before any processing which requires it and we will provide you with necessary information through our Consent Policy or otherwise as applicable. In order to fulfill legal obligations, we process your Personal Data when it is necessary for compliance with a legal tax, accounting, anti-money laundering, legal order, sanction checks or other obligations to which we are subject. On the basis of our legitimate interest we will use your Personal Data to: To communicate about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and products that supplement or improve our purchased products and to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication; To evaluate and to improve the performance and quality of our products, services and websites, develop new products, train our employees and to understand usage trends, and analyze user acquisitions, conversions and campaigns; To maintain and develop threat intelligence resources, in particular to be able to detect and block malware; To make our systems and applications more secure; To maintain the effective performance of our business by ensuring necessary internal administrative and commercial processes (e.g. finances, controlling, business intelligence, legal & compliance, fraud check, information security etc.); and To establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights. Your interests are a key part of our decision-making process and have been considered in all of the above-mentioned processing activities. We believe we have achieved a fair balance between privacy and operations. In any case, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to our particular situation, to those processing operations. For more details, please see section Your Privacy Rights. Balancing Legitimate Interests Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail. Security and Threat Intelligence We process Personal Data to support network and information security efforts. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data in a proportionate manner for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This covers the ability of our networks or of our information systems to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the data we store or transmit, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems. Moreover, as a member of the security community, we also cooperate with other players across the security landscape, in particular by exchanging threat intelligence resources, and aid in research and development of new security solutions. The Personal Data we process for the purpose listed above includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as: Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM); Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including phishing); Email header detail including addresses and intermediary systems (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email); Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files); Samples (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files); URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful content); and/or IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful content). Product messaging - In-product and Email Messages We have a legitimate interest for messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and about products that supplement or improve the products already purchased. We can also message our customers with information and offers relating to already purchased products (e.g. time-limited offers). If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software, and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems. Because of this, we have a legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you are likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time. We use certain limited subsets of Billing Data, Account Data, and Service Data to deliver this communication. Product and business improvement We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products. For example, we want to know how many users clicked on our offers, or purchased our product after seeing one of our ads. These analytics help us improve functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities as well as helping us to develop new products. This processing includes using third-party tools. Please refer to our Products Policy for the list of third-party tools used for the specific products and services. How We Process Your Personal Data We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use: For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated. For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own financial management activities. For both paid and free versions, we continuously monitor for, minimize, disconnect and remove all direct identifiers during the normal performance of the products and services. Processing of IP Addresses Your IP address is collected at the time at which your product or service is being provided for the purpose of downloading and installing the products, product authorization, fraud and malware detection and for the purpose of facilitating our billing process. In particular for delivering the content in accordance with your device(s) settings, determining appropriate language settings for communicating with you, troubleshooting issues, and generating appropriate diagnostics reports. We do not store the IP address from this process. Please refer to our Products Policy for specific use of IP address by our products and services. Personalization We use your answers from surveys, in which you can participate, and relevant Product Data to personalize communication and recommend our relevant products for you.In the United States only, for AntiVirus customers only, we may use certain limited Billing Data, Account Data, and Service Data that are already collected for the functioning of our products to make inferences about your purchase of our products in the future, in order to personalize discounts that we offer you. Data related to inferences and segments used for the personalization are kept for 60 days from their use for the creation of the offer. You can stop the use of your Personal Data for personalization by toggling the personalization setting to “off ”.We do not take any decisions solely based on algorithms, including profiling, that would significantly affect you. How We Disclose Your Personal Data We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group of companies, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, when required by applicable law. Processing is only undertaken for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and the relevant Products Policy sections. If we disclose your Personal Data, we require its recipients to comply with adequate privacy and confidentiality requirements, and security standards. Payment processors In certain cases we may use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us. However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility These are our long-term payment processors: Payment Processor Link to Privacy Policy Location Digital River https://www.digitalriver.com/privacy-policy/ US, Ireland Softline https://allsoftglobal.com/en/privacy-policy/ Cyprus Nexway https://www.nexway.com/legal-notice-privacy/ Germany, France, USA Cleverbridge https://www.cleverbridge.com/?scope=opprivacy Germany, USA, Japan, Taiwan, Malta Paypal (Braintree) https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full US, Ireland Google Play Store (for mobile apps) https://policies.google.com/privacy US, Ireland Apple Store (for mobile apps) https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/ US, Ireland Your Billing Data is processed by the payment processor from whom you purchased the product. Your data is processed according to the relevant processor’s terms and privacy policy. Service Providers We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and Products Policy. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential. Such service providers may include contact centers, professional consultants (including to defend or to exercise our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers. In particular, we use Salesforce to provide us the CRM platform (see their privacy information including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers). We use Medallia Inc. as the provider of the experience management platform used to collect and evaluate customer feedback and insights (see their privacy information including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers. Sometimes these service providers, for example our distributors, resellers, and app store partners will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships. Advertising Companies To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads in our products for mobile devices. To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product. The SDK collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you. Only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of any such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our Consent Policy which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy. Distributors, Resellers We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may communicate with you about Avast products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data. Cookies Providers Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, to tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and to give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products.. While using our websites, you will be asked to authorize the collection and use of data by cookies according to the terms of the Cookie Policy. Analytics Tool Providers We use analytical tools, including third-party analytical tools, which allow us to, among other things, to identify potential performance or security issues with our products, to improve their stability and function, to understand how you use our products, and websites so that we can optimize and improve your user experience, and to evaluate and improve our campaigns. We use Service and Device data for analytics. While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.

No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to: A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction; A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process; Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud. Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings Like any other company, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate. If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable. Information including personal data relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes. Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors We are a global business that provides products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it processed. At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data originating from the EEA outside of the EEA or cooperate with a third-party vendor located outside the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions adopted by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected. Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include: allowing access to Personal Data stored in the Google Cloud Platform to Google personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section). How We Protect Your Personal Data We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data. Administrative Safeguards Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave the company. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked. Technical Safeguards We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize technical safeguards such as up-to-date firewall protection for an additional layer of security, high-quality anti-virus software, and we regularly update our virus definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to adopt appropriate measures if we deem them necessary. Physical Safeguards Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards. Proportionality We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk. Children’s Privacy We may offer products and services designed specifically to assist you as a parent by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under the age specified in particular jurisdictions, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. Details about this processing is included in our Products Policy. Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information. How Long We Store Your Personal Data We will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods: For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights and keeping proper business records. We also keep your Billing data to enable the renewal of your subscriptions; For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service. We use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data. The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years. You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our Products Policy. Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease. After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years. We have measures in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws, including pseudonymization. Storage of Your Personal Data The data we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as third-party servers in the Czech Republic, in the United States, as well as anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate. In particular, we store some of the data in the Google Cloud Platform operated by Google Cloud EMEA Ltd. Personal Data originating from the EEA are stored on Google’s servers in the EEA, however, such data may be also accessed by Google personnel located outside the EEA. We put in place appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses, to address these cross-border transfers of Personal Data. In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

This information is used to bill those customers for their services and products. Our parent company, Gen Digital Inc., will act as a controller with respect to processing of the Billing Data and will provide its own privacy policy to the relevant customers at the moment of purchase of the relevant products and services. Billing Data includes your name, email address, billing address, your phone number, payment information (depending on method can include Credit/Debit Card Information or PayPal account) and device fingerprint ID.

In order to fulfill legal obligations, we process your Personal Data when it is necessary for compliance with a legal tax, accounting, anti-money laundering, legal order, sanction checks or other obligations to which we are subject. On the basis of our legitimate interest we will use your Personal Data to: To communicate about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and products that supplement or improve our purchased products and to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication; To evaluate and to improve the performance and quality of our products, services and websites, develop new products, train our employees and to understand usage trends, and analyze user acquisitions, conversions and campaigns; To maintain and develop threat intelligence resources, in particular to be able to detect and block malware; To make our systems and applications more secure; To maintain the effective performance of our business by ensuring necessary internal administrative and commercial processes (e.g. finances, controlling, business intelligence, legal & compliance, fraud check, information security etc.); and To establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights. Your interests are a key part of our decision-making process and have been considered in all of the above-mentioned processing activities. We believe we have achieved a fair balance between privacy and operations. In any case, you have the right to object, on grounds relating to our particular situation, to those processing operations. For more details, please see section Your Privacy Rights. Balancing Legitimate Interests Before relying on our legitimate interests, we balanced them against your interests and made sure they are compelling enough. With respect to the purposes below we consider necessary to explain what our interests are in detail. Security and Threat Intelligence We process Personal Data to support network and information security efforts. In line with EU data protection law, organizations have a recognized legitimate interest in collecting and processing Personal Data in a proportionate manner for the purposes of ensuring network and information security. This covers the ability of our networks or of our information systems to resist events, attacks or unlawful or malicious actions that could compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of the data we store or transmit, or the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via those networks and systems. Moreover, as a member of the security community, we also cooperate with other players across the security landscape, in particular by exchanging threat intelligence resources, and aid in research and development of new security solutions. The Personal Data we process for the purpose listed above includes, without limitation, network traffic data related to cyber-threats such as: Sender email addresses (e.g., of sources of SPAM); Recipient email addresses (e.g., of victims of targeted email cyberattacks including phishing); Email header detail including addresses and intermediary systems (e.g., as configured by cybercriminals sending malicious email); Filenames and execution paths (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files); Samples (e.g., of malicious or potentially harmful executable files); URLs and associated page titles (e.g., of web pages broadcasting or hosting malicious or otherwise harmful content); and/or IP addresses (e.g., of web servers and connected devices involved in the generation, distribution, conveyance, hosting, caching or other storage of cyber-threats such as malicious or otherwise harmful content). Product messaging - In-product and Email Messages We have a legitimate interest for messaging our users about possible security, privacy and performance improvements and about products that supplement or improve the products already purchased. We can also message our customers with information and offers relating to already purchased products (e.g. time-limited offers). If you are our customer, we feel a responsibility to inform you about security and utility improvements and possible problems to your device and software, and provide you with effective solutions relevant to these problems. Because of this, we have a legitimate interest to optimize the content and delivery of this type of communication to you so that you are likely to find them relevant and non-intrusive at the same time. We use certain limited subsets of Billing Data, Account Data, and Service Data to deliver this communication. Product and business improvement We have a legitimate interest to use necessary Personal Data to understand user conversions, acquisitions and campaign performance through various distribution channels, and users’ download, activation and interactions with our products. For example, we want to know how many users clicked on our offers, or purchased our product after seeing one of our ads. These analytics help us improve functionality, effectiveness, security and reliability of our products and business activities as well as helping us to develop new products. This processing includes using third-party tools. Please refer to our Products Policy for the list of third-party tools used for the specific products and services. How We Process Your Personal Data We do our best to disconnect or remove all direct identifiers from the Personal Data that we use: For free versions, this disconnection or removal of identifiers begins when the products and services are initially activated. For paid users we keep Billing Data in a separate database and minimize its use for anything other than handling payments and our own financial management activities.

Payment processors In certain cases we may use a third party payment processor to take payment from you. These third parties are properly regulated and authorized to handle your payment information and are prohibited from using your Personal Data for any other purposes other than arranging these services for us. However, they are independent controllers of your data with their own responsibility These are our long-term payment processors: Payment Processor Link to Privacy Policy Location Digital River https://www.digitalriver.com/privacy-policy/ US, Ireland Softline https://allsoftglobal.com/en/privacy-policy/ Cyprus Nexway https://www.nexway.com/legal-notice-privacy/ Germany, France, USA Cleverbridge https://www.cleverbridge.com/?scope=opprivacy Germany, USA, Japan, Taiwan, Malta Paypal (Braintree) https://www.paypal.com/en/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full US, Ireland Google Play Store (for mobile apps) https://policies.google.com/privacy US, Ireland Apple Store (for mobile apps) https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/ US, Ireland Your Billing Data is processed by the payment processor from whom you purchased the product.

Service Providers We may use contractors and service providers to process your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy and Products Policy. We contractually require service providers to keep data secure and confidential. Such service providers may include contact centers, professional consultants (including to defend or to exercise our rights), and marketing/survey/analytics/software suppliers. In particular, we use Salesforce to provide us the CRM platform (see their privacy information including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers). We use Medallia Inc. as the provider of the experience management platform used to collect and evaluate customer feedback and insights (see their privacy information including appropriate safeguards for cross-border transfers. Sometimes these service providers, for example our distributors, resellers, and app store partners will be independent controllers of your data and their terms and conditions, end user license agreements (“EULA”) and privacy statements will apply to such relationships. Advertising Companies To be able to offer our products and services for free, we serve third-party ads in our products for mobile devices. To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product. The SDK collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you. Only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of any such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our Consent Policy which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy. Distributors, Resellers We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may communicate with you about Avast products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data. Cookies Providers Our websites use cookies to personalize your experience on our sites, to tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns, and to give us insights into user interactions and user base as a whole so we can improve our communications and products..

We use Service and Device data for analytics. While we generally prefer using our own analytical tools, we sometimes need to partner with other parties, which have developed and provide us with their own tools and expertise. Below, we list these partners and tools and their privacy policies.

No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to: A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction; A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process; Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud. Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings Like any other company, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate. If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable. Information including personal data relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes. Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors We are a global business that provides products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it processed. At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data originating from the EEA outside of the EEA or cooperate with a third-party vendor located outside the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions adopted by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected. Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include: allowing access to Personal Data stored in the Google Cloud Platform to Google personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section). How We Protect Your Personal Data We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data. Administrative Safeguards Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave the company. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked. Technical Safeguards We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize technical safeguards such as up-to-date firewall protection for an additional layer of security, high-quality anti-virus software, and we regularly update our virus definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to adopt appropriate measures if we deem them necessary. Physical Safeguards Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards. Proportionality We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk. Children’s Privacy We may offer products and services designed specifically to assist you as a parent by providing child online protection features. In such cases, we will only collect and process Personal Data related to any child under the age specified in particular jurisdictions, which you choose to disclose to us or otherwise instruct us to collect and process. Details about this processing is included in our Products Policy. Please refer to the specific applicable notices for this information. How Long We Store Your Personal Data We will hold your Personal Data on our systems for the following periods: For Billing Data, for as long as we have a legal obligation or for our legitimate interests in establishing legal rights and keeping proper business records. We also keep your Billing data to enable the renewal of your subscriptions; For Product Data, only as long as necessary for the purposes of a particular product or service. We use rolling deletion periods which means we regularly delete collected data in the given periods starting from the collection of that respective data. The rolling deletion periods for Product Data are not longer than six years. You can find specific rolling deletion periods for each of our products and their purposes in our Products Policy. Please note that when you uninstall our product, processing for service provision, in-product messaging, analytics and third-party ads, if applicable, dependent on the installed product shall cease. After the uninstallation, we will continue to process your Product Data for statistical purposes for up to six years. We have measures in place to ensure compliance with data protection laws, including pseudonymization. Storage of Your Personal Data The data we collect from you may be stored, with risk-appropriate technical and organizational security measures applied to it, on in-house as well as third-party servers in the Czech Republic, in the United States, as well as anywhere we or our trusted service providers and partners operate. In particular, we store some of the data in the Google Cloud Platform operated by Google Cloud EMEA Ltd. Personal Data originating from the EEA are stored on Google’s servers in the EEA, however, such data may be also accessed by Google personnel located outside the EEA. We put in place appropriate safeguards, including Standard Contractual Clauses, to address these cross-border transfers of Personal Data. In all cases, we follow generally accepted standards and security measures to protect the personal data submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

We do not process special categories of personal data, such as data concerning health, race, ethnicity or political opinions, or deduce in any way this type of information from data, we collect within our products. We organize the Personal Data we process into these basic categories: Billing Data, Account Data, and Product Data. Billing Data The below described billing process applies to all customers who have purchased products and/or standalone features through our Gen eStore. This information is used to bill those customers for their services and products. Our parent company, Gen Digital Inc., will act as a controller with respect to processing of the Billing Data and will provide its own privacy policy to the relevant customers at the moment of purchase of the relevant products and services. Billing Data includes your name, email address, billing address, your phone number, payment information (depending on method can include Credit/Debit Card Information or PayPal account) and device fingerprint ID. Billing data What we use it for Email address To send you purchase receipts Name and Billing address To maintain billing records Payment information – payment card info, for businesses only VAT/Tax ID and Business ID To process the payment and billing records Identifiers – product and license keys/numbers, Wallet ID, Auto bill ID, Payment transaction ID To identify the product and enable features based on the purchased license and to track account activity between internal company systems, applications, and architecture. This data is also processed for the purpose of delivering the product in accordance with your device(s) as well as for trade compliance and fraud check. Renewability To check if a given subscription can be renewed under the same or similar terms Expiration date To check whether a license is current Device fingerprint ID To validate that an authenticated payment transaction occurred, and the payment card and account are appropriate for billing. In certain cases, you purchase our products and services from a trusted third-party service provider, reseller, or app store. In those circumstances, your Billing Data is processed by the relevant third party and we only receive a subset of this data to keep proper business records. In particular, we only have a masked credit/debit card number, not your full payment details. Account Data includes information to set up and customize an account, such as your name, email address and username, and information connected with our services, such as product, license and device information. For some of our products or some of their functions creating an account is necessary. Account Data is also used for customer management and engagement, revenue generation, and evaluation and optimization of operational, sales and business processes. Account Data See below an example of Account Data and what we use it for: Account data Name To customize our communications by addressing you by your name To send you communications regarding your license and support and to offer our other products and services Username To manage your account and facilitate your login into the service Account usage data (events such as request to end subscription, subscription-related information) To enable premium features activation, provide tailored life-cycle experience and communication with customer support, suitable product interface content. Subscription renewal date To help us validate the period the license is active Trial User To add a grace period prior to the paid period of the subscription An account is also necessary for some features of our Forum.

No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to: A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction; A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process; Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud. Mergers, Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings Like any other company, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate. If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable. Information including personal data relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes. Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors We are a global business that provides products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it processed. At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data originating from the EEA outside of the EEA or cooperate with a third-party vendor located outside the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions adopted by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected. Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include: allowing access to Personal Data stored in the Google Cloud Platform to Google personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section). How We Disclose Your Personal Data We only disclose your Personal Data as described below, within our group of companies, with our partners, with service providers that process data on our behalf and with public authorities, when required by applicable law.

To enable the ad, we embed a software development kit (“SDK”) provided by an advertising company into the product. The SDK collects Personal Data in order to personalize ads for you. Only few of our free products serve third-party ads. You will be asked for consent during the installation process of any such product. For further information, including the exact scope of processed Personal Data and names of relevant products, please refer to our Consent Policy which includes the list of our advertising partners and their privacy policy. We may provide your Personal Data to our partners for the purpose of distribution, sale or management of our products. Our partners may communicate with you about Avast products or services. In addition, you purchase our products directly from our distributor, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that distributor, reseller or an app store, such third party will also process your Personal Data.

No Personal Data will be disclosed to any public authority except in response to: A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court or other public authority of competent jurisdiction; A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for data, in that if we were to refuse to provide such data, it would be in breach of local law, and it or its officers, executives or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process; Where such disclosure is necessary for us to enforce our legal rights pursuant to applicable law; or A request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud.

Like any other company, we too go through our own cycle of growth, expansion, streamlining and optimization. Our business decisions and market developments therefore affect our structure. As a result of such transactions, and for maintaining a continued relationship with you, we may transfer your Personal Data to a related affiliate. If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition or sale of our assets, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you of any such deal and outline your choices in that event, when applicable. Information including personal data relating to our business may be shared with other parties in order to evaluate and conclude the transaction. This would also be the case if we were required by law to make such changes. Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data among Avast Entities and to Third-Party Vendors We are a global business that provides products and services all around the world. In order to reach all of our users and provide all of them with our software, we operate on an infrastructure that spans the globe. The servers that are part of this infrastructure may therefore be located in a country different than the one where you live. In some instances, these may be countries outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Regardless, we provide the same GDPR-level of protection to all Personal Data it processed. At the same time, when we transfer Personal Data originating from the EEA outside of the EEA or cooperate with a third-party vendor located outside the EEA, we always make sure to put in place appropriate safeguards, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions adopted by the European Commission, to ensure that your data remains safe and secure at all times and that your rights are protected. Situations where we transfer Personal Data outside of the EEA include: allowing access to Personal Data stored in the Google Cloud Platform to Google personnel located outside the EEA, the provisioning of our products and services and third-party services related to it, the processing of transactions and of your payment details, and the delivery of support services. Further, an outside-EEA transfer may also occur in case of a merger, acquisition or a restructuring, where the acquirer is located outside of the EEA (see the Mergers, Acquisitions and Restructurings section). How We Protect Your Personal Data We maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of your Personal Data. Administrative Safeguards Access to the Personal Data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave the company. Where an individual employee no longer requires access, that individual's credentials are revoked. Technical Safeguards We store your personal information in our database using the protections described above. In addition, we utilize technical safeguards such as up-to-date firewall protection for an additional layer of security, high-quality anti-virus software, and we regularly update our virus definitions. Third parties who we hire to provide services and who have access to our users' data are required to adopt appropriate measures if we deem them necessary. Physical Safeguards Access to user information in our database by Internet requires using an encrypted VPN, except for email which requires user authentication. Third-party contractors who process Personal Data on our behalf agree to provide reasonable physical safeguards. Proportionality We strive to collect no more Personal Data from you than is required by the purpose for which we collect it. This, in turn, helps reduce the total risk of harm should data loss or a breach in security occur: the less data we collect, the smaller the overall risk.
