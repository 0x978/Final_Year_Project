When your subscription renews each month/year, we will automatically charge your payment method on file for the subscription fee, as well as any applicable tax, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. You agree to provide updated payment information upon request and any time the information you previously provided is no longer valid. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, including if your payment method has not successfully settled.If you are located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.Skillshare collects all fees through secure third-party payment processors. Our third-party payment processors accept payments through methods detailed on the applicable payment screen, which may include various credit cards and PayPal. Such payment methods are subject to change. Information that you supply to our payment processors is not stored by us or within our control, and is subject to each of our third-party payment processors’ own privacy policies and terms and conditions.

If you do not wish to accept the price change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your subscription before the change takes effect.Price changes, whether pertaining to subscriptions or other products, may be the result of many factors, including changes in costs related to procuring content or providing the Services, changes to market conditions or the consumer price index, or changes to applicable tax rates. Should these costs go up, we may increase our prices accordingly. Should these costs go down, we may decrease our prices accordingly.You may be offered the opportunity to participate in additional programs, such as a student referral program. If you choose to participate in any such program, you will be subject to the terms of those programs, if any. More information on student referral programs can be found here.Free Trials and Other Promotions or SalesFrom time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of paid subscriptions to our Skillshare membership for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). Skillshare reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.For some Trials, we will require you to provide a payment method to start the Trial. At the end of such Trials, we will automatically charge you via that payment method for the applicable paid subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial and on a recurring monthly or annual basis, unless you cancel prior to the end of the free Trial, or before the renewal date, as applicable. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge using such payment method. If you do not want this initial charge, or the renewal charge, you must cancel the applicable paid subscription prior to the charge through your payment settings within your Skillshare account profile located at https://www.skillshare.com/settings/payments.We also occasionally run time-limited promotions and sales, during which time the cost of subscription may be lower. The subscription price we offer may be different when you are logged into your account compared to the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, for example because some of our promotions are available only to new users. Promotional or sale prices will typically be limited to a specified period of time (for example, one year for discounts on annual subscriptions). At the end of that period of time, your subscription will automatically renew at the then-applicable full price, unless you cancel prior to renewal by changing your settings on your account profile.RefundsPlease consult our Refund Policy to learn more about whether you might be entitled to a refund for your purchase.Skillshare has no obligation to consider or grant refund requests, including (i) for subscription plans purchased with a 7-day or longer free trial; or (ii) that otherwise do not follow our Refund Policy. To the extent permissible under applicable law, you are entitled to one refund only. Once a refund for a subscription is confirmed, you will lose all access to your Skillshare membership.We will not provide refunds to users who have acted in a fraudulent manner or in a way that violates or would violate these Terms or our Community Guidelines (as determined in our sole discretion), including users who have been deactivated for the same.If you purchased a subscription through the Apple iTunes Store, our iPhone application, the Google Play Store, or our Android application, please consult the refund policy associated with the service by which you subscribed.CancellationsYou may cancel your Skillshare membership at any time for any or no reason, but if you cancel your membership before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us or charged to your payment method except in the limited circumstances set forth in Section II.C above.

It affects your legal rights, including your right to file or participate in a lawsuit in court.(1) Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If a Dispute (as that term is defined below) arises between you and Skillshare, Skillshare is committed to working with you to try to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such Dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following email address: legal@skillshare.com. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Skillshare. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the Dispute, you and Skillshare agree to the further Dispute resolution provisions below.This informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.For sake of clarification only, the informal dispute resolution negotiation shall be individualized such that a separate negotiation must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution negotiation, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference.(2) Mutual Arbitration Agreement. If the informal dispute resolution procedure in Subpart (1) does not lead to resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, (except as provided for herein) subject to the terms set forth below and the National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to legal@skillshare.com. If you are a Skillshare account holder, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by you or Skillshare, must include the email address you used to create an account with Skillshare.Except as set forth below, you and Skillshare agree that by using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Skillshare and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors, and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Skillshare Entities”) arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms–including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or the timing of any administrative or arbitrator fees–(each a “Dispute”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with this Section VIII (the “Arbitration Agreement”).This Arbitration Agreement applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein.This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.The parties understand that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the Dispute, and that rights to discovery and appeals may be limited in arbitration. The parties further understand that the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation in some instances.You hereby acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms and Arbitration Agreement, you and Skillshare are each waiving the right to a trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by law.Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights) or for defamation; and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.(3) Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. You and Skillshare acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, except as set out otherwise in Subpart (6) below, any arbitration shall be conducted in an individual capacity only and not as a class or collective arbitration and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to resolve an individual party's claim; notwithstanding this acknowledgement and agreement, you agree that any arbitration involving you may proceed on a consolidated basis, but it may do so if and only if Skillshare provides its consent to consolidate in writing.With the exception of this Subpart (3) and Subpart (6) below, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of NAM, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, this Subpart (3) or Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.(4) Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by NAM and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of NAM, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.(5) Arbitration Location and Procedure. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York (unless otherwise agreed by the parties).The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party’s failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Arbitration Agreement.(a) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Notice. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms.(b) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Instances. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Skillshare submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary or the parties agree otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.(c) Dispositive Motions. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.(d) Confidentiality. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Skillshare (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).(6) Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Skillshare (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in sequential batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that 10% of the anticipated total number of batches for the Mass Filing may proceed simultaneously as set forth in this batching provision and Arbitration Agreement, but that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior set of batches is filed, processed, and adjudicated (for example: if 2000 demands were presented as part of a Mass Filing, there would be 20 anticipated batches, 10% of which – i.e., 2 batches – may proceed simultaneously); (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Skillshare and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a batch proceeding and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each batch including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved, and (vii) to make good faith efforts to resolve each batch of claims properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication within 180 days, failing which any of the claimants whose demands have not yet begun arbitration or Skillshare may cease arbitration and file in a court of competent jurisdiction.Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.You agree to cooperate in good faith with Skillshare and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Skillshare otherwise consents in writing, Skillshare does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Subpart (6). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.(7) Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first completely adjudicated batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from a group of 5 mediators proposed by NAM, with Skillshare and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Skillshare, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Skillshare or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Skillshare nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.(8) Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of Section X “Disclaimer of Warranties” and Section XI “Limitation of Liability” as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No individual arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.(9) Fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Skillshare will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Subpart (6)) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.(10) 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@skillshare.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT”. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you currently use to access your Skillshare account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. You become subject to this Arbitration Agreement on (a) October 4, 2023, or (b) the date you create your Skillshare account (if you created your account after October 4, 2023), whichever is later. Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Skillshare also will not be bound by it.(11) Changes. Skillshare will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any material changes to this Section VIII. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Skillshare provides this notice and apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Skillshare changes this Section VIII after the date you first accepted this Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Arbitration Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.Class Action WaiverYou may only resolve your dispute with Skillshare on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action. Except as described in Section VIII(6), class actions, class arbitrations, collective actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.Disclaimer of WarrantiesThe Service and all materials included therein (whether housed on the Service alone or also on a third-party platform) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or the warranty of non-infringement.

You agree and understand and intend that this assumption of risk and release is binding upon you and your heirs, executors, agents, administrators, and assigns.Some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdictional restrictions are applicable.If applicable, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, in relevant part: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”IndemnificationUpon a request by us, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and the other Skillshare Parties harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that arise from your violation of these Terms or any of the other Governing Documents, or negligent or wrongful conduct, including with respect to any User Content you upload or place onto the Skillshare Platform.

When your subscription renews each month/year, we will automatically charge your payment method on file for the subscription fee, as well as any applicable tax, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. You agree to provide updated payment information upon request and any time the information you previously provided is no longer valid. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, including if your payment method has not successfully settled.If you are located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.Skillshare collects all fees through secure third-party payment processors. Our third-party payment processors accept payments through methods detailed on the applicable payment screen, which may include various credit cards and PayPal. Such payment methods are subject to change. Information that you supply to our payment processors is not stored by us or within our control, and is subject to each of our third-party payment processors’ own privacy policies and terms and conditions.

Skillshare disclaims all liability with regard to any fees or problems you have with third-party payment processors.If you enroll in a Skillshare subscription via a gift card or scholarship, you will not be required to provide a payment method at the time of enrollment and your subscription will end automatically at the conclusion of the subscription period provided by your gift card or scholarship. If you wish to continue your subscription beyond that period, you will need to enroll in an automatically renewing subscription and provide a method of payment.Skillshare reserves the right to develop and launch new products or services or make changes to any products or services offered through the Service.

If you do not wish to accept the price change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your subscription before the change takes effect.Price changes, whether pertaining to subscriptions or other products, may be the result of many factors, including changes in costs related to procuring content or providing the Services, changes to market conditions or the consumer price index, or changes to applicable tax rates. Should these costs go up, we may increase our prices accordingly. Should these costs go down, we may decrease our prices accordingly.You may be offered the opportunity to participate in additional programs, such as a student referral program. If you choose to participate in any such program, you will be subject to the terms of those programs, if any. More information on student referral programs can be found here.Free Trials and Other Promotions or SalesFrom time to time, we or others on our behalf may offer trials of paid subscriptions to our Skillshare membership for a specified period without payment or at a reduced rate (a “Trial”). Skillshare reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law.For some Trials, we will require you to provide a payment method to start the Trial. At the end of such Trials, we will automatically charge you via that payment method for the applicable paid subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial and on a recurring monthly or annual basis, unless you cancel prior to the end of the free Trial, or before the renewal date, as applicable. By providing your payment details in conjunction with the Trial, you agree to this charge using such payment method. If you do not want this initial charge, or the renewal charge, you must cancel the applicable paid subscription prior to the charge through your payment settings within your Skillshare account profile located at https://www.skillshare.com/settings/payments.We also occasionally run time-limited promotions and sales, during which time the cost of subscription may be lower. The subscription price we offer may be different when you are logged into your account compared to the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, for example because some of our promotions are available only to new users. Promotional or sale prices will typically be limited to a specified period of time (for example, one year for discounts on annual subscriptions). At the end of that period of time, your subscription will automatically renew at the then-applicable full price, unless you cancel prior to renewal by changing your settings on your account profile.RefundsPlease consult our Refund Policy to learn more about whether you might be entitled to a refund for your purchase.Skillshare has no obligation to consider or grant refund requests, including (i) for subscription plans purchased with a 7-day or longer free trial; or (ii) that otherwise do not follow our Refund Policy.

It affects your legal rights, including your right to file or participate in a lawsuit in court.(1) Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If a Dispute (as that term is defined below) arises between you and Skillshare, Skillshare is committed to working with you to try to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such Dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following email address: legal@skillshare.com. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Skillshare. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the Dispute, you and Skillshare agree to the further Dispute resolution provisions below.This informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.For sake of clarification only, the informal dispute resolution negotiation shall be individualized such that a separate negotiation must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution negotiation, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference.(2) Mutual Arbitration Agreement. If the informal dispute resolution procedure in Subpart (1) does not lead to resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, (except as provided for herein) subject to the terms set forth below and the National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to legal@skillshare.com. If you are a Skillshare account holder, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by you or Skillshare, must include the email address you used to create an account with Skillshare.Except as set forth below, you and Skillshare agree that by using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Skillshare and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors, and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Skillshare Entities”) arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms–including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or the timing of any administrative or arbitrator fees–(each a “Dispute”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with this Section VIII (the “Arbitration Agreement”).This Arbitration Agreement applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein.This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.The parties understand that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the Dispute, and that rights to discovery and appeals may be limited in arbitration. The parties further understand that the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation in some instances.You hereby acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms and Arbitration Agreement, you and Skillshare are each waiving the right to a trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by law.Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights) or for defamation; and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.(3) Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. You and Skillshare acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, except as set out otherwise in Subpart (6) below, any arbitration shall be conducted in an individual capacity only and not as a class or collective arbitration and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to resolve an individual party's claim; notwithstanding this acknowledgement and agreement, you agree that any arbitration involving you may proceed on a consolidated basis, but it may do so if and only if Skillshare provides its consent to consolidate in writing.With the exception of this Subpart (3) and Subpart (6) below, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of NAM, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, this Subpart (3) or Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.(4) Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by NAM and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of NAM, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.(5) Arbitration Location and Procedure. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York (unless otherwise agreed by the parties).The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party’s failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Arbitration Agreement.(a) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Notice. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms.(b) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Instances. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Skillshare submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary or the parties agree otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.(c) Dispositive Motions. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.(d) Confidentiality. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Skillshare (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).(6) Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Skillshare (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in sequential batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that 10% of the anticipated total number of batches for the Mass Filing may proceed simultaneously as set forth in this batching provision and Arbitration Agreement, but that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior set of batches is filed, processed, and adjudicated (for example: if 2000 demands were presented as part of a Mass Filing, there would be 20 anticipated batches, 10% of which – i.e., 2 batches – may proceed simultaneously); (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Skillshare and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a batch proceeding and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each batch including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved, and (vii) to make good faith efforts to resolve each batch of claims properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication within 180 days, failing which any of the claimants whose demands have not yet begun arbitration or Skillshare may cease arbitration and file in a court of competent jurisdiction.Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.You agree to cooperate in good faith with Skillshare and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Skillshare otherwise consents in writing, Skillshare does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Subpart (6). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.(7) Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first completely adjudicated batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from a group of 5 mediators proposed by NAM, with Skillshare and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Skillshare, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Skillshare or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Skillshare nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.(8) Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of Section X “Disclaimer of Warranties” and Section XI “Limitation of Liability” as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No individual arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.(9) Fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Skillshare will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Subpart (6)) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.(10) 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@skillshare.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT”. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you currently use to access your Skillshare account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. You become subject to this Arbitration Agreement on (a) October 4, 2023, or (b) the date you create your Skillshare account (if you created your account after October 4, 2023), whichever is later. Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Skillshare also will not be bound by it.(11) Changes. Skillshare will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any material changes to this Section VIII. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Skillshare provides this notice and apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Skillshare changes this Section VIII after the date you first accepted this Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Arbitration Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes.Class Action WaiverYou may only resolve your dispute with Skillshare on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action. Except as described in Section VIII(6), class actions, class arbitrations, collective actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed.Disclaimer of WarrantiesThe Service and all materials included therein (whether housed on the Service alone or also on a third-party platform) are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or the warranty of non-infringement.

You agree and understand and intend that this assumption of risk and release is binding upon you and your heirs, executors, agents, administrators, and assigns.Some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdictional restrictions are applicable.If applicable, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, in relevant part: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”IndemnificationUpon a request by us, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and the other Skillshare Parties harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that arise from your violation of these Terms or any of the other Governing Documents, or negligent or wrongful conduct, including with respect to any User Content you upload or place onto the Skillshare Platform.

When your subscription renews each month/year, we will automatically charge your payment method on file for the subscription fee, as well as any applicable tax, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. You agree to provide updated payment information upon request and any time the information you previously provided is no longer valid. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, including if your payment method has not successfully settled.If you are located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.Skillshare collects all fees through secure third-party payment processors.

Promotional or sale prices will typically be limited to a specified period of time (for example, one year for discounts on annual subscriptions). At the end of that period of time, your subscription will automatically renew at the then-applicable full price, unless you cancel prior to renewal by changing your settings on your account profile.RefundsPlease consult our Refund Policy to learn more about whether you might be entitled to a refund for your purchase.Skillshare has no obligation to consider or grant refund requests, including (i) for subscription plans purchased with a 7-day or longer free trial; or (ii) that otherwise do not follow our Refund Policy.

You shall be responsible for any additional charges to which you may be subject by your credit or debit card provider or bank, or any currency exchange rate fluctuations and Skillshare does not accept liability for these.Skillshare is not obliged to offer refunds for Tickets purchased for a specific date, should you change your mind about your purchase or fail to attend the Event.

Before you purchase a Ticket, Skillshare or the hosting Teacher will generally inform you of any restrictions which apply to entry. Skillshare will not be responsible for the consequences of any failure by you to abide by such information provided pre-purchase. Ticket holders may also be ejected from an Event at any time if Skillshare employees or an event organizer or those working on their behalf determines that the Ticket holder is acting in contravention of the law, is a safety or security risk, may affect the enjoyment of others at the Event, or may cause damage, nuisance, or injury.If You See Something That Infringes Your CopyrightIn accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), we’ve adopted the following policy toward copyright infringement. We reserve the right to (1) block access to or remove material that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our advertisers, affiliates, content providers, members, or users, and (2) remove and discontinue service to repeat offenders.Procedure for Reporting Copyright Infringements. If you believe that material or content residing on or accessible through the Service infringes your copyright (or the copyright of someone whom you are authorized to act on behalf of), please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the following information to Skillshare’s Designated Agent to Receive Notification of Claimed Infringement (our “Designated Agent,” whose contact details are listed below):A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright that has been allegedly infringed;Identification of works or materials being infringed;Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing, including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that Skillshare is capable of finding and verifying its existence;Contact information about the notifier, including address, telephone number, and, if available, email address;A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material identified as infringing is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; andA statement made under penalty of perjury that the information provided is accurate and the notifying party is authorized to make the complaint on behalf of the copyright owner.Once Proper Bona Fide Infringement Notification is Received by the Designated Agent. Upon receipt of a proper notice of copyright infringement, we reserve the right to:Remove or disable access to the infringing material;Notify the content provider who is accused of infringement that we have removed or disabled access to the applicable material; andTerminate such content provider's access to the Service if he or she is a repeat offender.Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent. If the content provider believes that the material that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or the content provider believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the copyright owner's agent, or, pursuant to the law, the content provider, may send us a counter-notice containing the following information:A physical or electronic signature of the content provider;Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or disabled;A statement that the content provider has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; andThe content provider's name, address, telephone number, and, if available, email address, and a statement that such person or entity consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district in which the content provider’s address is located, or, if the content provider's address is located outside the United States, for any judicial district in which Skillshare is located, and that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of the alleged infringement.If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Skillshare may, in its discretion, send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person that Skillshare may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court order against the content provider accused of committing infringement, the removed material will be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days after receipt of the counter-notice.Please contact Skillshare's Designated Agent at DMCA@skillshare.com. Alternatively, you may send a complete notice of copy infringement to the following address:Skillshare, Inc.Attn: Platform Operations Department215 Park Avenue South, 11th FloorNew York, NY 10003Arbitration AgreementPlease read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights, including your right to file or participate in a lawsuit in court.(1) Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If a Dispute (as that term is defined below) arises between you and Skillshare, Skillshare is committed to working with you to try to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such Dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following email address: legal@skillshare.com. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Skillshare. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the Dispute, you and Skillshare agree to the further Dispute resolution provisions below.This informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.For sake of clarification only, the informal dispute resolution negotiation shall be individualized such that a separate negotiation must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution negotiation, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference.(2) Mutual Arbitration Agreement. If the informal dispute resolution procedure in Subpart (1) does not lead to resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, (except as provided for herein) subject to the terms set forth below and the National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to legal@skillshare.com. If you are a Skillshare account holder, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by you or Skillshare, must include the email address you used to create an account with Skillshare.Except as set forth below, you and Skillshare agree that by using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Skillshare and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors, and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Skillshare Entities”) arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms–including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or the timing of any administrative or arbitrator fees–(each a “Dispute”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with this Section VIII (the “Arbitration Agreement”).This Arbitration Agreement applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein.This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.The parties understand that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the Dispute, and that rights to discovery and appeals may be limited in arbitration. The parties further understand that the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation in some instances.You hereby acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms and Arbitration Agreement, you and Skillshare are each waiving the right to a trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by law.Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights) or for defamation; and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.(3) Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. You and Skillshare acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, except as set out otherwise in Subpart (6) below, any arbitration shall be conducted in an individual capacity only and not as a class or collective arbitration and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to resolve an individual party's claim; notwithstanding this acknowledgement and agreement, you agree that any arbitration involving you may proceed on a consolidated basis, but it may do so if and only if Skillshare provides its consent to consolidate in writing.With the exception of this Subpart (3) and Subpart (6) below, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of NAM, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, this Subpart (3) or Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.(4) Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by NAM and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of NAM, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.(5) Arbitration Location and Procedure. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York (unless otherwise agreed by the parties).The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party’s failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Arbitration Agreement.(a) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Notice. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms.(b) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Instances. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Skillshare submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary or the parties agree otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.(c) Dispositive Motions. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.(d) Confidentiality. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Skillshare (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).(6) Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Skillshare (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in sequential batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that 10% of the anticipated total number of batches for the Mass Filing may proceed simultaneously as set forth in this batching provision and Arbitration Agreement, but that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior set of batches is filed, processed, and adjudicated (for example: if 2000 demands were presented as part of a Mass Filing, there would be 20 anticipated batches, 10% of which – i.e., 2 batches – may proceed simultaneously); (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Skillshare and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a batch proceeding and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each batch including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved, and (vii) to make good faith efforts to resolve each batch of claims properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication within 180 days, failing which any of the claimants whose demands have not yet begun arbitration or Skillshare may cease arbitration and file in a court of competent jurisdiction.Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.You agree to cooperate in good faith with Skillshare and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Skillshare otherwise consents in writing, Skillshare does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Subpart (6). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.(7) Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first completely adjudicated batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from a group of 5 mediators proposed by NAM, with Skillshare and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Skillshare, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Skillshare or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Skillshare nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.(8) Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of Section X “Disclaimer of Warranties” and Section XI “Limitation of Liability” as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No individual arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.(9) Fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Skillshare will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Subpart (6)) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.(10) 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@skillshare.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT”. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you currently use to access your Skillshare account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.

You agree and understand and intend that this assumption of risk and release is binding upon you and your heirs, executors, agents, administrators, and assigns.Some jurisdictions prohibit the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitations may not apply to you to the extent such jurisdictional restrictions are applicable.If applicable, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, in relevant part: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”IndemnificationUpon a request by us, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and the other Skillshare Parties harmless from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, that arise from your violation of these Terms or any of the other Governing Documents, or negligent or wrongful conduct, including with respect to any User Content you upload or place onto the Skillshare Platform.

It affects your legal rights, including your right to file or participate in a lawsuit in court.(1) Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If a Dispute (as that term is defined below) arises between you and Skillshare, Skillshare is committed to working with you to try to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such Dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following email address: legal@skillshare.com. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Skillshare. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the Dispute, you and Skillshare agree to the further Dispute resolution provisions below.This informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.For sake of clarification only, the informal dispute resolution negotiation shall be individualized such that a separate negotiation must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution negotiation, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference.(2) Mutual Arbitration Agreement. If the informal dispute resolution procedure in Subpart (1) does not lead to resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, (except as provided for herein) subject to the terms set forth below and the National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to legal@skillshare.com. If you are a Skillshare account holder, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by you or Skillshare, must include the email address you used to create an account with Skillshare.Except as set forth below, you and Skillshare agree that by using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Skillshare and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors, and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Skillshare Entities”) arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms–including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or the timing of any administrative or arbitrator fees–(each a “Dispute”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with this Section VIII (the “Arbitration Agreement”).This Arbitration Agreement applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein.This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16.The parties understand that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the Dispute, and that rights to discovery and appeals may be limited in arbitration. The parties further understand that the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation in some instances.You hereby acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms and Arbitration Agreement, you and Skillshare are each waiving the right to a trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by law.Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights) or for defamation; and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action.(3) Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. You and Skillshare acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, except as set out otherwise in Subpart (6) below, any arbitration shall be conducted in an individual capacity only and not as a class or collective arbitration and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to resolve an individual party's claim; notwithstanding this acknowledgement and agreement, you agree that any arbitration involving you may proceed on a consolidated basis, but it may do so if and only if Skillshare provides its consent to consolidate in writing.With the exception of this Subpart (3) and Subpart (6) below, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of NAM, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, this Subpart (3) or Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.(4) Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by NAM and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of NAM, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider.(5) Arbitration Location and Procedure. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York (unless otherwise agreed by the parties).The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party’s failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Arbitration Agreement.(a) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Notice. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms.(b) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Instances. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Skillshare submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary or the parties agree otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.(c) Dispositive Motions. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.(d) Confidentiality. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Skillshare (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).(6) Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Skillshare (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in sequential batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that 10% of the anticipated total number of batches for the Mass Filing may proceed simultaneously as set forth in this batching provision and Arbitration Agreement, but that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior set of batches is filed, processed, and adjudicated (for example: if 2000 demands were presented as part of a Mass Filing, there would be 20 anticipated batches, 10% of which – i.e., 2 batches – may proceed simultaneously); (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Skillshare and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a batch proceeding and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each batch including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved, and (vii) to make good faith efforts to resolve each batch of claims properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication within 180 days, failing which any of the claimants whose demands have not yet begun arbitration or Skillshare may cease arbitration and file in a court of competent jurisdiction.Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted.You agree to cooperate in good faith with Skillshare and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Skillshare otherwise consents in writing, Skillshare does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Subpart (6). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled.The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing.(7) Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first completely adjudicated batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from a group of 5 mediators proposed by NAM, with Skillshare and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Skillshare, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Skillshare or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Skillshare nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing.(8) Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of Section X “Disclaimer of Warranties” and Section XI “Limitation of Liability” as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No individual arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration.(9) Fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Skillshare will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement.The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Subpart (6)) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge.(10) 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@skillshare.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT”. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you currently use to access your Skillshare account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. You become subject to this Arbitration Agreement on (a) October 4, 2023, or (b) the date you create your Skillshare account (if you created your account after October 4, 2023), whichever is later. Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Skillshare also will not be bound by it.(11) Changes. Skillshare will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any material changes to this Section VIII. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Skillshare provides this notice and apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Skillshare changes this Section VIII after the date you first accepted this Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Arbitration Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. Please read this section carefully. It affects your legal rights, including your right to file or participate in a lawsuit in court. (1) Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure. If a Dispute (as that term is defined below) arises between you and Skillshare, Skillshare is committed to working with you to try to reach a reasonable resolution. For any such Dispute, both parties acknowledge and agree that they will first make a good faith effort to resolve it informally before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding in arbitration or otherwise. Such informal resolution requires first sending a written description of the dispute to the other party. For any Dispute you initiate, you agree to send the written description of the Dispute along with the email address associated with your account, if applicable, to the following email address: legal@skillshare.com. The written description must be on an individual basis and provide, at minimum, the following information: your name; a description of the nature or basis of the claim or dispute; the specific relief sought; and proof of your relationship with Skillshare. If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the written description of the Dispute, you and Skillshare agree to the further Dispute resolution provisions below. Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure This informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding. Failure to engage in this process could result in the award of fees against you in arbitration. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process. For sake of clarification only, the informal dispute resolution negotiation shall be individualized such that a separate negotiation must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal dispute resolution negotiation, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you shall also fully participate in the conference. (2) Mutual Arbitration Agreement. If the informal dispute resolution procedure in Subpart (1) does not lead to resolution, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve Disputes, (except as provided for herein) subject to the terms set forth below and the National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) rules. If you are initiating arbitration, a copy of the demand shall also be emailed to legal@skillshare.com. If you are a Skillshare account holder, any demand initiating arbitration, whether filed by you or Skillshare, must include the email address you used to create an account with Skillshare. Mutual Arbitration Agreement Except as set forth below, you and Skillshare agree that by using the Services in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against Skillshare and/or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, and each of their respective current or former members, officers, directors, and employees (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Skillshare Entities”) arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms–including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms are void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, and any dispute regarding the payment, non-payment, or the timing of any administrative or arbitrator fees–(each a “Dispute”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration in accordance with this Section VIII (the “Arbitration Agreement”). This Arbitration Agreement applies to claims that arose, were asserted, or involve facts occurring before the existence of this Arbitration Agreement or any prior agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Arbitration Agreement, in accordance with the notice and opt-out provisions set forth herein. This Arbitration Agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16. The parties understand that an arbitrator and not a judge or jury will decide the Dispute, and that rights to discovery and appeals may be limited in arbitration. The parties further understand that the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation in some instances. You hereby acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms and Arbitration Agreement, you and Skillshare are each waiving the right to a trial by a jury to the maximum extent permitted by law. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all Disputes through arbitration, each party retains the right to (i) elect to have any claims resolved in small claims court on an individual basis for disputes and actions within the scope of such court’s jurisdiction, regardless of what forum the filing party initially chose; (ii) bring an action in state or federal court to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” in this context means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets and other confidential or proprietary information, but not privacy or publicity rights) or for defamation; and (iii) seek a declaratory judgment, injunction, or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction regarding whether a party’s claims are time-barred or may be brought in small claims court. Seeking such relief shall not waive a party’s right to arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, and any filed arbitrations related to any action filed pursuant to this paragraph shall automatically be stayed pending the outcome of such action. (3) Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver. You and Skillshare acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent allowed by law, except as set out otherwise in Subpart (6) below, any arbitration shall be conducted in an individual capacity only and not as a class or collective arbitration and the arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to resolve an individual party's claim; notwithstanding this acknowledgement and agreement, you agree that any arbitration involving you may proceed on a consolidated basis, but it may do so if and only if Skillshare provides its consent to consolidate in writing. Class Arbitration and Collective Relief Waiver With the exception of this Subpart (3) and Subpart (6) below, if any part of this Arbitration Agreement is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of NAM, then the balance of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal, or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, this Subpart (3) or Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. (4) Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will be administered by NAM and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of NAM, including, as applicable, NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures, Fees For Disputes When One of the Parties is a Consumer and the Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures in effect at the time any demand for arbitration is filed with NAM, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class or representative actions. The applicable NAM rules and procedures are available at www.namadr.com or by emailing National Arbitration and Mediation’s Commercial Dept at commercial@namadr.com. If NAM is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitration provider. Arbitration Rules (5) Arbitration Location and Procedure. For all U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held (i) at a location determined under the applicable NAM rules and procedures that is reasonably convenient for you and is no more than 100 miles from your home or place of business; or (ii) at another location you and we agree upon. For non-U.S. residents, the arbitration shall be held in New York City, New York (unless otherwise agreed by the parties). Arbitration Location and Procedure The arbitrator shall apply New York law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator or arbitration body shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions in accordance with the NAM rules and procedures for any frivolous claims or submissions the arbitrator determines have not been filed in good faith, as well as for a party’s failure to comply with the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedure contemplated by this Arbitration Agreement.(a) Arbitration Demand Must Contain Sufficient Notice. Any arbitration demand or counterclaim asserted by either party must contain sufficient information to provide fair notice to the other party of the asserting party’s identity, the claims being asserted, and the factual allegations on which they are based, and must include proof that the claimant is party to this Arbitration Agreement and to these Terms. The arbitrator and/or NAM may require amendment of any demand or counterclaim that does not satisfy these requirements. The arbitrator has the right to impose sanctions for any claims the arbitrator determines to be frivolous or improper (under the standard set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11), including for any claim filed on behalf of a claimant who is not a party to this Arbitration Agreement or to these Terms.(b) Arbitration Conducted on Papers in Some Instances. If the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 and you do not seek injunctive or declaratory relief, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Skillshare submit to the arbitrator, unless the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary or the parties agree otherwise. If the amount in controversy exceeds $10,000 or seeks declaratory or injunctive relief, either party may request (or the arbitrator may determine) to hold a hearing, which shall be via videoconference or telephone conference unless the parties agree otherwise.(c) Dispositive Motions. Subject to the applicable NAM rules and procedures, the parties agree that the arbitrator will have the discretion to allow the filing of dispositive motions if they are likely to efficiently resolve or narrow issues in dispute.(d) Confidentiality. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, all arbitration proceedings will be confidential and closed to the public and any parties other than you and Skillshare (and each of the parties’ authorized representatives and agents), and all records relating thereto will be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of the arbitration award (provided that the party seeking confirmation shall seek to file such records under seal to the extent permitted by law).

Confidentiality (6) Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, in the event 100 or more similar arbitration demands (those asserting the same or substantially similar facts or claims, and seeking the same or substantially similar relief) presented by or with the assistance or coordination of the same law firm(s) or organization(s) are submitted to NAM against Skillshare (“Mass Filing”), the parties agree (i) to administer the Mass Filing in sequential batches of 100 demands per batch (to the extent there are fewer than 100 arbitration demands left over after the batching described above, a final batch will consist of the remaining demands); (ii) to designate one arbitrator for each batch; (iii) to accept applicable fees, including any related fee reduction determined by NAM in its discretion; (iv) that 10% of the anticipated total number of batches for the Mass Filing may proceed simultaneously as set forth in this batching provision and Arbitration Agreement, but that no other demands for arbitration that are part of the Mass Filing may be filed, processed, or adjudicated until the prior set of batches is filed, processed, and adjudicated (for example: if 2000 demands were presented as part of a Mass Filing, there would be 20 anticipated batches, 10% of which – i.e., 2 batches – may proceed simultaneously); (v) that fees associated with a demand for arbitration included in a Mass Filing, including fees owed by Skillshare and the claimants, shall only be due after your demand for arbitration is included in a batch proceeding and that batch is properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication; (vi) that the staged process of batched proceedings, with each batch including 100 demands, shall continue until each demand (including your demand) is adjudicated or otherwise resolved, and (vii) to make good faith efforts to resolve each batch of claims properly designated for filing, processing, and adjudication within 180 days, failing which any of the claimants whose demands have not yet begun arbitration or Skillshare may cease arbitration and file in a court of competent jurisdiction. Batch Arbitration Arbitrator selection for each batch shall be conducted to the greatest extent possible in accordance with the applicable NAM rules and procedures for such selection, and the arbitrator will determine the location where the proceedings will be conducted. You agree to cooperate in good faith with Skillshare and the arbitration provider to implement such a “batch approach” or other similar approach to provide for an efficient resolution of claims, including the payment of combined reduced fees, set by NAM in its discretion, for each batch of claims. The parties further agree to cooperate with each other and the arbitration provider or arbitrator to establish any other processes or procedures that the arbitration provider or arbitrator believe will provide for an efficient resolution of claims. Any disagreement between the parties as to whether this provision applies or as to the process or procedure for batching shall be resolved by a procedural arbitrator appointed by NAM. This “Batch Arbitration” provision shall in no way be interpreted as increasing the number of claims necessary to trigger the applicability of NAM’s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures or authorizing class arbitration of any kind. Unless Skillshare otherwise consents in writing, Skillshare does not agree or consent to class arbitration, private attorney general arbitration, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as set forth in this Subpart (6). If your demand for arbitration is included in the Mass Filing, your claims will remain tolled until your demand for arbitration is decided, withdrawn, or is settled. The parties agree that this batching provision is integral to the Arbitration Agreement insofar as it applies to a Mass Filing. If the batching provision in this Subpart (6) is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void, and neither you nor Skillshare shall be entitled to arbitrate any claim that is a part of the Mass Filing. (7) Mediation Following First Batch in a Mass Filing. The results of the first completely adjudicated batch of demands will be given to a NAM mediator selected from a group of 5 mediators proposed by NAM, with Skillshare and the remaining claimants’ counsel being able to strike one mediator each and then rank the remaining mediators and the highest collectively ranked mediator being selected. The selected mediator will try to facilitate a resolution of the remaining demands in the Mass Filing. After the results are provided to the mediator, Skillshare, the remaining claimants and their counsel, and the mediator will have 90 days (the “Mediation Period”) to agree on a resolution or substantive methodology for resolving the outstanding demands. If the parties are unable to resolve the outstanding demands during the Mediation Period, and cannot agree on a methodology for resolving them through further arbitrations, either Skillshare or any remaining claimant may opt out of the arbitration process and have the demand(s) proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction. Notice of the opt-out will be provided in writing within 60 days of the close of the Mediation Period. If neither Skillshare nor the remaining claimants opt out and they cannot agree to a methodology for resolving the remaining demands through further arbitration, the arbitrations will continue with the batching process. Absent notice of an opt-out, the arbitrations will proceed in the order determined by the sequential numbers assigned to demands in the Mass Filing. (8) Arbitrator’s Decision. The arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the terms and conditions of these Terms and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Services. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable NAM rules and procedures. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary damages on an individual basis and to grant, on an individual basis, any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual to the extent available under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that the damages and/or other relief must be consistent with the terms of Section X “Disclaimer of Warranties” and Section XI “Limitation of Liability” as to the types and the amounts of damages or other relief for which a party may be held liable. No individual arbitration award or decision will have any preclusive effect as to issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration. Attorneys’ fees will be available to the prevailing party in the arbitration if authorized under applicable substantive law governing the claims in the arbitration. (9) Fees. If you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Skillshare will pay any filing and hearing fees in excess of $250 that the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith, in which case arbitration fees (including attorneys’ fees) may be imposed upon you consistent with the Arbitrator’s Rules and the standard for sanctions set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. You are responsible for your own attorneys’ fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise, including as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. The parties agree that NAM has discretion to reduce the amount or modify the timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under NAM’s Rules where it deems appropriate (including as specified in Subpart (6)) provided that such modification does not increase the costs to you, and you further agree that you waive any objection to such fee modification. The parties also agree that a good-faith challenge by either party to the fees imposed by NAM does not constitute a default, waiver, or breach of this Arbitration Agreement while such challenge remains pending before NAM, the arbitrator, and/or a court of competent jurisdiction, and that any and all due dates for those fees shall be tolled during the pendency of such challenge. (10) 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to legal@skillshare.com with the subject line, “ARBITRATION OPT-OUT”. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you currently use to access your Skillshare account (if you have one), and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. You become subject to this Arbitration Agreement on (a) October 4, 2023, or (b) the date you create your Skillshare account (if you created your account after October 4, 2023), whichever is later. Otherwise, you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, you may exercise your right to a trial by jury or judge, as permitted by applicable law, but any prior existing agreement to arbitrate disputes under a prior version of the Arbitration Agreement will not apply to claims not yet filed. If you opt out of the Arbitration Agreement, Skillshare also will not be bound by it. (11) Changes. Skillshare will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any material changes to this Section VIII. Any such changes will go into effect 30 days after Skillshare provides this notice and apply to all claims not yet filed regardless of when such claims may have accrued. If Skillshare changes this Section VIII after the date you first accepted this Arbitration Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Arbitration Agreement), you agree that your continued use of the Services 30 days after such change will be deemed acceptance of those changes. Class Action WaiverYou may only resolve your dispute with Skillshare on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action. Except as described in Section VIII(6), class actions, class arbitrations, collective actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. You may only resolve your dispute with Skillshare on an individual basis, and may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, collective, consolidated, or representative action.
