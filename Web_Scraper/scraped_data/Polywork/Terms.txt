Terms of Service Last Updated: Sep 12, 2023 PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY TO ENSURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND EACH PROVISION. THIS AGREEMENT CONTAINS A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS. This is a contract between you and Company. You must read and agree to these terms before purchasing or using any Company Services. If you do not agree, you may not use or purchase any Services. You may use our Services only if you can form a binding contract with Company, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to any Services by anyone under the Minimum Age is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. Minimum Age means 16 years old. However, if law requires that you must be older in order for Polywork to lawfully provide the Services to you without parental consent (including using of your personal data) then the Minimum Age is such older age. Unless an exception is granted by the Company in its sole discretion, the Services are not available to any Users previously removed from the Services by Company. You agree that, unless we state otherwise, English will be the language for all transactions and interactions arising out of this Agreement. Third-Party Services and Terms. We may make available to you the ability to use or purchase additional Services (each, a “Third-Party Service”) provided by our partners or other third parties (each, a “Third Party”) from us or directly from the Third Party. Third Parties may have their own terms, conditions and policies (collectively, “Third-Party Terms”), and you agree that it’s your obligation to review and abide by those Third-Party Terms (in addition to this Agreement). You acknowledge and agree that we do not control Third-Party Services and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we are not liable to you or any other person or entity for any problems or damages arising out of or relating to your use of a Third-Party Service, including, but not limited to, any Third Party’s action or inaction related to any Third-Party Services or decision to suspend or terminate any Third-Party Services. In addition to any other applicable Third-Party Terms that may apply from time to time, you acknowledge and agree that the following Third-Party Terms apply and you will comply with them for the following specified Services: Domain Name Registration Services: We act as a reseller to Tucows Domains Inc., an ICANN accredited domain name registrar, and we may provide you with the ability to apply for, register and maintain domain names registered through Tucows. If you use our Services to apply for, register, maintain or take any other action with regard to any domain names, you agree that, in addition to this Agreement, you are bound by and you will comply with the following Master Domain Registration Agreement required by Tucows located at: https://www.opensrs.com/wp-content/uploads/Tucows_ExhibitA.html (the “Domain Name Agreement”). Note that we are the “Reseller” for purposes of the Domain Name Agreement. Please review the Domain Name Agreement and all Third-Party Terms of other parties referenced in the Domain Name Agreement, such as Third-Party Terms related to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) and the relevant top-level domain registries, including but not limited to ICANN’s Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy located on ICANN’s website at https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/policy-2012-02-25-en. SSL Certificates: As a part of our Services, we may assist you with provisioning an SSL certificate for your domain name. “Let’s Encrypt” certificates are subject to and governed by Third-Party Terms found on Internet Security Research Group’s website located at: https://letsencrypt.org/, including but not limited to their web page containing their policy and legal repository: https://letsencrypt.org/repository/. ZeroSSL certificates are subject to and governed by Third-Party Terms found on ZeroSSL GmbH’s website located at: https://zerossl.com/, including but not limited to their web page containing their terms and conditions: https://zerossl.com/terms/. You agree that you are bound by and will comply with the Third-Party Terms of the applicable issuer of your SSL certificates, as they may be modified from time to time. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including, but not limited to, your payment of all applicable fees), you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, freely revocable right and license to access and use our Services for your personal, noncommercial use only and as permitted by the features of the Services. Company reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the Services and the Company Content (as defined below). Company may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason, as described further below. We may require you to establish a user account with us for some or all of our Services (a “User Account”). Your User Account gives you access to certain Services that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. We may maintain different types of User Accounts for different types of Users. If you open a User Account on behalf of a company, organization, or other entity, then (i) “you” includes you and that entity, and (ii) you represent and warrant that you are an authorized representative of the entity with the authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, and that you agree to this Agreement on the entity’s behalf. By connecting to Company with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service. You are not permitted to use another User’s User Account without permission. When creating your User Account, you must provide accurate and complete information, and you must keep this information up to date. You are solely responsible and liable for the activity that occurs on your User Account (including, but not limited to, all purchases made through your User Account), and you must keep your User Account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols, and are at least 12 characters long) with your User Account. You must notify Company immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized access to or use of your password or other authentication credentials or User Account. Company will not be liable for any losses, damages or charges caused by any unauthorized use of your User Account. If you no longer wish to use our Services, you may request by email to legal@polywork.com that the Company delete your account, or you may delete your profile yourself using the profile settings within your User Account. You agree to abide by any storage limitations associated with our Services as specified by us on our website. Even if a Service is referred to as having “unlimited storage,” and regardless of any storage limitations being noted on our website, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) our Services do not serve, and you will not use our Services, as your backup or archive for information or data, (ii) we have no obligation to backup any of your information or data, (iii) you will keep a copy of all information and data that is important to you, and (iv) if your usage of our Services adversely affects other Users’ experience with or use of our Services (including, but not limited to, the amount of storage you use), we may suspend or terminate your Services without liability. We may, without prior notice, change any Services; stop providing Services (or features of any Services) to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Services (collectively, “Service Changes”). You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any such Service Changes and that your continued use of the Services constitutes your acceptance of any such Service Changes. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend this Agreement, your account, or your access to the Services without notice and liability for any reason, including, but not limited to, (1)(i) if, in our sole determination, you violate any provision of this Agreement, or we believe your use of our Services could expose us to legal liability in any jurisdiction, (ii) to protect the integrity and stability of our systems or the systems of a Third Party, (iii) for fraud and abuse detection or prevention efforts, (iv) to comply with a court order or requests from law enforcement, (v) to comply with any of our obligations imposed by any Third Party, (vi) to defend against any actual or threatened legal action, (vii) in response to complaints from others related to your use of any of our Services, or (viii) for any other reason expressly provided herein (a “for Cause” suspension or termination), or (2)(i) for no reason (a “for Convenience” suspension or termination). You agree to pay us all applicable fees as designated on our website for the Services you order or as designated by us in the ordering process. All fees for any order you place are subject to change at the time of any renewal or as otherwise provided herein. All fees are due immediately and are non-refundable, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, on our website at the time of your purchase, or as required by law. You are responsible for payment of all applicable taxes (other than taxes based on our income), including, but not limited to, sales tax, use tax, value added tax, and other taxes and governmental charges and duties on your purchase of Services (collectively, “Taxes”). You agree to pay all Taxes related to the Services or payments made by you hereunder. All fees for Services are listed, and shall be paid, in U.S. dollars. Payments for Services are to be made via a charge to your credit card, debit card or other payment method acceptable to us (your “Payment Method”) as collected and processed by our third-party payment processor, Stripe, Inc. (the “Processor”). You acknowledge and agree that your submission of your Payment Method will be directly to our Processor, that we do not collect your credit card or other financial account information, and you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions with our Processor in connection with your payment of fees for Services. You are solely responsible for ensuring your Payment Method is up to date with our Processor. By submitting an order for Services, you authorize Company and Processor to charge the applicable fees using your Payment Method. You agree that all annual and monthly subscriptions and any other recurring fees related to any Services will be recurring transactions billed on an ongoing basis using your Payment Method until the Services are canceled or the Agreement is terminated in accordance with this Agreement. Any Service purchased on a month-to-month basis (a “Monthly Subscription”) will automatically renew each month at the then-current fees applicable to the Service as listed on our website until terminated as provided in this Agreement. Any Service purchased on an annual basis (an “Annual Subscription”) will automatically renew at the end of each 12-month period for additional one-year periods at the then-current fees applicable to the Service as listed on our website until terminated as provided in this Agreement. Any renewal of your Services is subject to the then-current version of this Agreement and payment of all applicable fees. Except in connection with Monthly Subscriptions or as otherwise required by law, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of an upcoming renewal of your Services prior to the renewal date. For Annual Subscriptions, you agree that we and our Processor may charge your Payment Method for each renewal on a date that is no more than thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date. You agree that we or our Processor may extend the expiration date (using third-party services for such purposes) on your Payment Method on file with our Processor in order to effect a renewal. If your Payment Method fails or is rejected for any reason in connection with a renewal (a “Failed Payment”), you agree that we may, but shall not be obligated to, (i) notify you by email to permit you to update your Payment Method information, and (ii) make additional attempts to charge your Payment Method for the applicable renewal fees. You acknowledge and agree that in the event of a Failed Payment we will terminate the applicable Services as of the end of the paid subscription or registration term or the end of any then-applicable grace period provided by us (as designated by us on our website or confirmed to you in writing), whichever is later. You agree to be responsible and reimburse us for all fees we incur due to a Failed Payment. We may, but shall not be obligated to, change any of your Services to any “free” version of our Services after terminating any fee-based Services due to a Failed Payment, and you agree that your use of any Services after any such termination is governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Services are controlled and operated from facilities in the United States. You acknowledge and agree that you are accessing and entering into this Agreement as hosted by us on our servers in the United States. Company makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Services from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations. You may not use the Services if you are a resident of a country embargoed by the United States, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by the United States government. Some areas of the Services allow Users to submit, post, display, provide, or otherwise make available content (or links to such content) such as profile information, videos, images, music, comments, questions, and other content or information (any such materials a User submits, posts, displays, provides, or otherwise makes available on the Services is referred to as “User Content”). WE CLAIM NO OWNERSHIP RIGHTS OVER USER CONTENT CREATED BY YOU. THE USER CONTENT YOU CREATE REMAINS YOURS. However, you understand that certain portions of the Services may allow other Users to view, share, and/or otherwise interact with your User Content. By providing or sharing User Content through the Services, you agree to allow others to view, share, and/or interact with your User Content in accordance with this Agreement. Company has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is shared via the Services. By submitting, posting, displaying, providing, or otherwise making available any User Content on or through the Services, you expressly grant, and you represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, to Company a royalty-free, sublicensable, transferable, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, worldwide license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, list information regarding, edit, translate, distribute, syndicate, publicly perform, publicly display, and make derivative works of all such User Content and your name, voice, and/or likeness as contained in your User Content, in whole or in part, and in any form, media or technology, whether now known or hereafter developed, for use in connection with the Services and Company’s (and its successors’ and affiliates’) business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Services (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels. You also hereby grant each User of the Services a non-exclusive license to access your User Content through the Services, and to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform such User Content as permitted through the functionality of the Services and under this Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction. In connection with your User Content, you affirm, represent and warrant the following: You have the written consent of each and every identifiable natural person in the User Content, if any, to use such person’s name or likeness in the manner contemplated by the Services and this Agreement, and each such person has released you from any liability that may arise in relation to such use. You have obtained and are solely responsible for obtaining all consents as may be required by law to post any User Content relating to third parties. Your User Content and Company’s use thereof as contemplated by this Agreement and the Services will not violate any law or infringe any rights of any third party, including but not limited to any Intellectual Property Rights and privacy rights. Company may exercise the rights to your User Content granted under this Agreement without liability for payment of any guild fees, residuals, payments, fees, or royalties payable under any collective bargaining agreement or otherwise. To the best of your knowledge, all your User Content and other information that you provide to us is truthful and accurate. Company takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other User or third-party posts, sends, or otherwise makes available over the Services. You shall be solely responsible for your User Content and the consequences of posting, publishing it, sharing it, or otherwise making it available on the Services, and you agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for your online distribution and publication of your User Content. You understand and agree that you may be exposed to User Content that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate for children, or otherwise unsuited to your purpose, and you agree that Company shall not be liable for any damages you allege to incur as a result of or relating to any User Content. Our “Opportunities” feature is designed to allow Users to post information about professional and other collaboration opportunities (each, an “Opportunity”) they are making available (e.g., looking for a guest on a podcast, looking for beta testers, looking to fill a full-time position, etc.) and to communicate directly with one another concerning Opportunities. Our “Collaboration” feature is designed to allow Users to post information about the types of collaboration they are open to considering (“Collaboration Availability”), and to communicate directly with one another concerning Collaboration Availability and potential collaboration projects (e.g., guest lecturing, providing resume feedback, full time employment, etc.). Users must have an account with Polywork to post an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability, and to use the Services to communicate directly with a User who has posted an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability; however, posted Opportunities and Collaboration Availability can be viewed and shared by all Users (which, please remember, includes visitors to the Services). A User with a Polywork account can use the Services to send a direct message to a User who has posted an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability, and the posting User can decide whether or not to respond to the message. Subject to compliance with this Agreement, the two Users may continue using the Services to communicate about the Opportunity or Collaboration Availability. We reserve the right to disable, limit or delete your account or remove some or all of your User Content if we believe that you have violated this Agreement (which includes the Community Guidelines) or if we believe that you have misused the Services in any way or if we believe your use of the Services could harm our brand, the value of the Services or other Users’ enjoyment of the Services. In addition to your other obligations under this Agreement, you agree that you will not, and you will not assist or authorize any other party to, do any of the following in connection with the Services: Copy, scrape, publish or otherwise reproduce content from another party’s website, or post content pertaining to another party, without that party’s prior authorization; Post or send any misleading, deceptive, harassing, defamatory, objectionable, infringing or unlawful content, or use the Services to engage or attempt to engage in any misleading, deceptive, harassing, defamatory, objectionable, infringing or unlawful activity; Share or otherwise use another User’s information without that User’s express permission; Use our Services to contact a User who has posted an Opportunity or Collaboration Availability for any purposes other than those legitimately related to the particular Opportunity or Collaboration Availability; Except as expressly authorized by us, use any automated process to access, copy, modify, or acquire any content on Polwork; Post any content that contains malware, spyware or other malicious code, or that otherwise interferes with the operation of the Services or any device or system (of Polywork or any other party); Breach or circumvent, or attempt to breach or circumvent, any security measure of Polywork or any other party; You agree that we may share your User Content and any information about your account with law enforcement authorities investigating any illegal activity related to your use of our Services, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. You agree that we may share your User Content and any information about your account with law enforcement authorities investigating any illegal activity related to your use of our Services, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. A username may be created by a registered User on Polywork subject to availability and any technical and other limitations set by Polywork. You agree not to create or use a username that infringes or violates the rights of Polywork or any third party. Polywork reserves the right to disallow the use of a username in its sole discretion, and may, in its sole discretion, reserve certain usernames and not permit them to be used by some or all Users. Such reserved usernames may be set aside by us for any reason or no reason at all. Polywork reserves the right to change, disable or delete any already-claimed or in-use username in its sole discretion. In such cases, Polywork will (subject to the terms of this Agreement) make a reasonable effort to provide the User with an opportunity to create an alternative username. Without limiting the foregoing, you agree that we reserve the right to change, disable or delete your username, without notice, if a third party claims that your username or your use of our Services infringes or violates the rights (including, but not limited to, intellectual property rights) of a third party. If you register a domain name through our Services (which includes any purchase of a domain name from a third-party other than Tucows), we will use reasonable efforts to submit your request for a domain name to and through our third-party registrar, Tucows. Upon any successful registration of a domain name, you will be the “registrant” (sometimes referred to as the domain holder or domain owner) for the domain name, which means, among other things, you will be solely responsible and liable for the domain name and how it is used. If you register a domain name through our Services, we may list our company as your billing contact for the domain name. Subject to your payment of all fees owed to us for the domain name and any renewals, we will, during the term of this Agreement, make payment to Tucows to maintain your domain name registration. You acknowledge and agree that a domain name you register through us can and will only point to a website you have set up through our Services (whether a free website or a monthly or annual subscription website). If you wish to use any such domain name for another purpose, or if you no longer maintain a website through our Services, you will be required to establish an individual retail account directly with Tucows or another accredited registrar for continued support of the domain name, and those providers might charge you additional fees for such services. We may also permit you to point your domain name to, or otherwise associate your domain name with, your User Content on our Services, regardless of whether you use our Services to register your domain name (“Your Domain Name”). We may permit you to list us as one of your domain name contacts other than the billing contact in the domain name registration record (e.g., administrative contact or technical contact) to allow us to perform certain functions on your behalf in connection with the domain name. You agree to respond promptly to all email communications we send to you concerning Your Domain Name. You agree that we are authorized to take any action, and we shall not be liable to you or any other person for any action we take, that we deem reasonably necessary or appropriate as a contact for Your Domain Name. You acknowledge and agree that we do not control the domain name registrar or registry associated with Your Domain Name, and we shall have no liability to you or anyone else for any act or omission by any registrar or registry, including but not limited to mistakes by any of them or decisions by any of them to suspend or terminate Your Domain Name or related services.

You acknowledge and agree that Your Website will consist of your User Content and our Company Content (as defined below). You acknowledge and agree that all of your obligations, and all rights you’ve granted, under this Agreement pertaining to your User Content apply to Your Website.

All Transactions in which you engage must be handled separately by you outside of our Services. We may provide you with sample information and descriptions (“Sample Descriptions”) to help you get started with creating your personalized online biography. Sample Descriptions provided to you may be the same as or similar to the Sample Descriptions we provide to other Users. The Sample Descriptions may not be accurate or appropriate descriptions of you or your bio. You agree to review all Sample Descriptions carefully and make all changes necessary to ensure the information you use for your online bio is accurate and appropriate. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any information you include in your online bio (or anywhere else in our Services), including information that is inaccurate or inappropriate.

Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code from, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works from any Company Content.

You may choose to or we may invite you to submit comments or ideas about the Services, including without limitation about how to improve the Services or our products (“Ideas”). By submitting any Idea, you agree that your disclosure is gratuitous, unsolicited and without restriction and will not place Company under any fiduciary or other obligation, and that we are free to use the Idea without any additional compensation to you, and/or to disclose the Idea on a non-confidential basis or otherwise to anyone. You further acknowledge that, by acceptance of your submission, Company does not waive any rights to use similar or related ideas previously known to Company, or developed by its employees, or obtained from sources other than you. You acknowledge that you do not own the User Account you use to access the Services, nor do you possess any rights of access or rights to data stored by or on behalf of Company on Company servers, including without limitation any data representing or embodying any Company Content. You agree that Company has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate Company Content as it sees fit in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Company will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. All data on Company’s servers are subject to deletion, alteration or transfer. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY VALUE ATTRIBUTED TO SUCH DATA BY YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY DATA, USER ACCOUNT HISTORY AND USER ACCOUNT CONTENT RESIDING ON COMPANY’S SERVERS, MAY BE DELETED, ALTERED, MOVED OR TRANSFERRED AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON IN COMPANY’S SOLE DISCRETION, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND.
