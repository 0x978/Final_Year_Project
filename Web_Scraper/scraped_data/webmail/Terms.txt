NEW TERMS & CONDITIONS FROM 1 JUNE 2022 We’re Updating Your Terms & Conditions With effect from 1 June 2022, we’re updating the standard terms and conditions which apply to all BT products, including BT TV & Sport, due to new Ofcom regulations designed to improve your rights where we make changes to your service. We’ve summarised the key changes on this page, but you can find a full copy of the new terms and conditions using the appropriate link(s) below: BT Home Phone & Broadband terms BT Mobile terms for all customers with effect from 1st June 2022 BT TV terms for all customers with effect from 1st June 2022 The changes mean that: · There may be more chances to cancel your plan where we make changes to it. From 1 June, if we make any changes to your terms and conditions or your core charges that are not to your benefit you will have the right to leave early with no charge to you. Other changes will give you the right to leave early if you’re significantly disadvantaged, as today; · In some situations where we make changes to your terms and conditions, you may be able to leave other plans you have with us, and we will tell you when that happens; · For mobile plans we can increase the cost of roaming calls (calls made while you’re outside the UK) because our roaming partners increase the costs. If we do you will have the right to leave your BT plan if you are materially worse off; · For all plans we can also increase the cost of international calls and text (calls made while you’re in the UK) because of increases in wholesale costs. If we do you will have the right to leave your BT plan if you are materially worse off; · It’s clearer that there is a separate set of terms and conditions for each product you have with us; · For BT customers whose contracts started before 1st September 2020 and whose minimum terms end after 31st March 2022. There are a couple of extra changes to your terms. We’ve referred to the fact we comply with any voluntary Ofcom codes we’re signed up to. And we’ve added a bit of detail about how data from your allowance is used up to help you better understand where your allowance goes; and · We’ll continue to notify you of any contractual changes and your rights with a minimum of 30 days’ notice. If you have any questions about these changes, please refer to the FAQs below. Thanks BT Frequently asked questions The changes to your terms are a result of new EU regulations designed to protect you, otherwise known as the European Electronic Communications Code.  The EECC is an EU directive which regulates electronic communications networks and services in the EU. The code is enforced by Ofcom, the UK’s Communications Regulator. The UK is bound to the EECC as part of the Brexit Transition period agreement and BT must comply with the requirements of the code. No, these changes are in your interest and designed to protect you from future non-contractual changes which are not in your benefit. We’ll continue to notify you of any changes with a minimum of 30 days’ notice, including telling you whether you have the right to cancel a service or leave your whole plan if appropriate. The changes improve the rights you have when we make changes to your plan or services. Where we do make changes, you will be able to cancel the service that’s changing and, in some situations, you may be able to cancel other services you have with us. We will make sure we tell you what services you can cancel when we tell you about a change. Annual RPI or CPI related price increases are written into our terms and conditions; and you are asked to agree to these terms at the point of sale. An annual RPI or CPI related price increase does not allow you to leave your plan early. Sometimes our roaming partners (Telco’s like us in other countries) put up the cost of roaming. When they do that, your roaming cost will increase too but you will be able to cancel your plan if the increase is material for you. It’s very similar to how things are today but due to the new rules we have to make that clear to you. Sometimes our international partners (Telco’s like us in other countries) put up the cost of calls and texts to those countries from the UK. When they do that your international calls and/or texts cost will increase too but you will be able to cancel your plan if the increase is material for you. It’s very similar to how things are today but due to the new rules we have to make that clear to you. If we change the terms and conditions of your TV contract or we change your core TV price, you’ll be able to leave your TV plan without paying a fee. Any changes to the package, the service, channels, and content allow you to cancel your plan if you're significantly disadvantaged, as today. You can always contact us whenever we make a change to your service to discuss your options.
