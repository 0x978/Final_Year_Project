Data from Children Under the Age of 18 An Authorized Individual-Representative may authorize and/or have access to a FollowMyHealth Universal Health Record for a Dependent.

Each Authorized Individual-Representative agrees that a Dependent's FollowMyHealth account also may be linked to the FollowMyHealth account of another Authorized Individual-Representative, and each Authorized Individual-Representative will have the same rights to access and communicate through the Dependent's FollowMyHealth account.
