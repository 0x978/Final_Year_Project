James Bush  Welcome. This site is a personal project. It explores technology, computer science, and digital privacy. I am a software engineer, working primarily in DevOps and cloud application development. I studied Computer Science at Oregon State University from 2020-2023. Before that, I practiced law. Site philosophy/design: This site is created with a commitment to a private and performant web. The goal is to ensure each page demands less than 1MB in total client-side resources.
