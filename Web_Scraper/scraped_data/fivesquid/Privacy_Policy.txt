Born in 2011, fivesquid is a British company that has grown to become one of the best known and trusted online marketplaces for trading skills-based services. Our mission remains as it was when we started; to provide the opportunity for everyone - be they an individual looking to use their skills to generate extra income or a company seeking cost effective short-term resources through a fair and open trading platform, and all this with a good dose of humour. Our community offers an extensive range of services for every budget, at prices £5, £10, £20 or £50, as well as the option to create custom orders at a bespoke price. Upgraded PRO Sellers can offer all their services at any price - we’ve seen jobs in the thousands. PRO Sellers also enjoy a host of other features, such as offering recurring services on subscription. We have an impressive global community of members, spanning over 100 countries. Individuals and companies alike sell services to boost their income and likewise, companies, individuals and fellow freelancers use the platform to secure cost-effective, short term resources - we credit this to our simple to use, secure and intuitive platform. We operate a fixed fee structure, so the price and timeframe for delivery of each service is clear from the outset. Buyers know what they are paying for prior to purchase, so there are no hidden surprises; and should anything go awry, our customer support team are on hand to get things back on track. The team behind the scenes have our members at the forefront when thinking of ways to improve the fivesquid platform. With our odd British ways, our informal but respectful approach, and the helpful nature of our support desk team, we strive to deliver a great service to our community with a good dose of humour. As a fivesquid member, be that a freelancer or company, a buyer or seller - your success is our success, and if we can inject some laughs along the way then that ticks the fivesquid box for us.
