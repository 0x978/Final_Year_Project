 Terms may be changed any time at their discretion, without notice to the user . Usernames can be rejected for any reason. The service is provided 'as is' and to be used at the users' sole risk. The service can delete your account without prior notice and without a reason. You maintain ownership of your data. Instead of asking directly, this Service will assume your consent merely from your usage.. Invalidity of any portion of the Terms of Service does not entail invalidity of its remainder. The court of law governing the terms is in a jurisdiction that is less friendly to user privacy protection.
