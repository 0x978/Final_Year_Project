Here is how (self.gfycat)submitted 7 months ago * by chopeYAs you may know, since the Gfycat acquisition by Snap (creators of Snapchat), Gfycat has basically stopped its operations. There is radio silence from the staff, uploads are not working for over 2 months. Now the website is not available because of the SSL certificate that has expired today. This is a silly technical issue, meaning that there is no one that's keeping an eye on the platform. If the Gfycat / Snap staff have allowed such a trivial but critical situation to occur, then it's very clear that the website has already been forgotten and these may be the last days we can still access the content. ​ Right now, the website is still "fully" working, and it's just your browser blocking the access, due to expired certificates (security reasons - HSTS policy enabled on Gfycat servers). How to access gfycat.com website We have to disable HSTS in our browser for all gfycat subdomains. Google Chome: For each link from the list below: Open it in Chrome You should see a warning saying that the connection is not secure. Type thisisunsafe . Literally, type it anywhere on the warning page (but not in the URL bar), even though there is no text input on this site. Just try it! Page should refresh itself automatically, showing you some code or errors in plain text If the page refreshed itself, move to the next link After doing that for each link, you should be able to open gfycat.com, browse all the content, log in, etc. Other browsers: I haven't tested it on other browsers, but you can find some tutorials on how to disable HSTS for a website. Example: https://sectigostore.com/blog/how-to-disable-hsts-in-chrome-firefox/ ​ Please note that this only works for your browser - it won't make your gifs available for others. ​ Gfycat subdomain links: weblogin.gfycat.com api.gfycat.com thumbs.gfycat.com profiles.gfycat.com metrics.gfycat.com giant.gfycat.com fat.gfycat.com zippy.gfycat.com assets.gfycat.com gfycat.com ​ Cheers, we had a good run 😔 83 commentssharesavehidereportall 83 commentssorted by: besttopnewcontroversialoldrandomq&alive (beta)Want to add to the discussion?Post a comment!Create an account[–]ShineAsNine 8 points9 points10 points 7 months ago (21 children)For anyone that wants to do some last minute downloading I created a gfycat downloader tool and updated it to disable ssl verification. It works to download users profiles and collections or single gfys as well. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]TheGreatestBread 3 points4 points5 points 7 months ago (0 children)Thank you!

Downloading other users profiles it'll only download public gfys. Downloading a collection will download all the gfys in the collection. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]doctorgecko 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago* (0 children)Where do you get the authentication key? EDIT: Nevermind I found it. If anyone else is having trouble the instructions are on the github page, and it should look something like this (at least on chrome on a windows computer), with all the stuff you copy paste where I added the black rectangle. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]_gaslit_ 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (2 children)Does this still work? Every gfycat URL I try it with says "invalid url". They're all individual gfycat URLs, e.g. https://gfycat.com/incredibleanchoredcony permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]ShineAsNine 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (1 child)It still works, are you putting the single gfys in a text file and downloading with the text file option? The only way to download single gfys is using the text file option. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]HailSithis201 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (4 children)Hey sorry to bother you but I’m a complete buffoon when it comes to this sort of stuff. Could you explain how to use this in layman’s terms? permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]ShineAsNine 3 points4 points5 points 7 months ago (3 children) Download the exe from here Run the exe Choose what type of download you want to do, look here for explanations on the types of downloads Fill out the steps on the opened exe permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]HailSithis201 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (0 children)Okay I’ll give this a shot, thank you. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]loonaspikachuu 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)what do u type when it says output directory: permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]ShineAsNine 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (0 children)The output folder, e.g. C:\Users\user\Downloads permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]-RevBlade- 1 point2 points3 points 4 months ago (0 children)Just wanted to say thank you for this. I had thousands of gifs and managed to save them all using this tool. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]therealatri 0 points1 point2 points 5 months ago (0 children)cant thank you enough for this! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]RevWaldo 4 points5 points6 points 7 months ago (0 children)If it helps anyone, I was able to access (most?) of my files by going though the Wayback Machine at the Internet Archive (https://archive.org). Enter the URL for your account - https://gfycat.com/@YourUserNameHere, then open each gif in a separate tab or window. Once the page loads, right-click the video to save it. (You can even save the image from the preview grid if you want.) Some pages didn't load of course, and you may need to reload a couple of times. Happy hunting! permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]impactmirror 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (0 children)I want to say thank you so much for this. Couldn't find my original files and I was gonna be so sad but managed to save my 130+ gifs this way. You're a lifesaver. Bummed about gfycat but at least I have my gifs back. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]Apo996 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (3 children)Hello guys.., I just the guide, and I know it sounds stupid, but I dont really get the step > "type it anywhere" I mean, on the blank white screen I cant type anything, so where am I suppose to type it ?Anywhere in the code, when I open inspect of the page? thanks for helping! :) permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Anywhere on that Chrome warning page, there is nowhere to type, you won't see typed letters unless you type the whole phrase and the page will refresh itself. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]XXBEERUSXX 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Just type it, you don't need to click anywhere permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Apo996 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)ohhh I see.. holy sh*t, just type it straight away, got it thanks! didnt even know that it can work like this :D permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]sussoutthemoon 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (0 children)I was able to get on the site but could not log in. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]HailSithis201 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)I can view my page but how can I scrub the stuff from my profile without manually download everything? I saw someone shared something about using Python but I’m terrible with code. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]Lucky_Morning_4131 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Wow how'd you figure this out? I also found the 'thisisunsafe' from stack overflow after a google, but I had no clue you had to do it for all of those links other than just gfycat. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 4 points5 points6 points 7 months ago (0 children)Gfycat uses these subdomains under the hood, some of them can be visible in the network inspector tool. Also I developed some tools for gfycat, I know its API for quite some time permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Lucky_Morning_4131 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (3 children)This allows me to properly access gifs by browsing through gfycat which is great, but I wonder if you also have a way to access links directly? For example, I can now access a gif, but if I copy paste the gif link into a new tab it just gives me a page not found error. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (2 children)Yes, it seems like the website can be accessed only from the homepage (gfycat.com) to be functional. For accessing the gif directly, just paste its "gfyname" into the Gfycat search. For example, gfycat.com/NippyKindLangur -> search for "NippyKindLangur". If the search result redirects you back to Not found error, then you have to clear the cache: Go to the home page - gfycat.com Hard reload by pressing Ctrl+Shift+R (in Chrome) Use search once again permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]XXBEERUSXX 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)I can now access gfycat and my gallery, but I can't access any gifs directly by using the search even after clearing the cache permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]_gaslit_ 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Does this still work? I can access gfycat.com, but NippyKindLangur turns up No Results Found ever after reloading like you said permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]doctorgecko 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)I've been able to get that to work for most subdomains, but I haven't had any luck with zippy or assets. I type thisisunsafe repeatedly and nothing happens permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Gfycat should work without these subdomains permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Kaju_researcher 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Thanks, how long will this work for before it shuts down for real? permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]reject_wannabecuck 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)This seems to no longer be working, for me at least. Nor the internet archive :( permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Works for me permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]kpopfan1234 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)wait this method doesn’t work anymore right permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)It still works permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–][deleted] 7 months ago (4 children)[deleted] [–]XXBEERUSXX 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (3 children)I tried this and it didn't work for any gifs, I even disabled SSL certificate check and tried fat, zippy and changing it to webm permalinkembedsavereportreply[–][deleted] 7 months ago (1 child)[deleted] [–]SKT_KhaZix 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Try capitalizing the first letters of the URL for each word in the unique ID permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]kenjiro_uchiha 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Warning: Do this at your own risk, as doing so forces the website to load in unsecure/unecrypted HTTP mode. HSTS stands for HTTP Strict Transport Security. It is a method used by websites to declare that they should only be accessed using a secure connection (HTTPS). permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Nope, in this case, all the traffic still goes through HTTPS protocol, web browsers are only denying the requests because of expired certificate. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]SK0215 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (2 children)This is gonna seem like such a stupid question because I am not a computer person at all but what do you mean exactly for step 3 (typing “thisisunsafe”)? Where else on the warning page other than the URL bar is there to type on? For me, when I click those links in the bottom, a page pops up that says “Your connection is not private…blah blah blah” and I can click either “learn more”, “advanced”, or “reload”. There is nowhere for me to type anything on this page… Or did you mean I have to open up the code for the warning page and type “thisisunsafe” somewhere on there? Sorry for the dumb question but I am just so confused right now. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Exactly, there is nowhere to type but it works, try it! You don't have to click anything, just have this tab focused. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]SK0215 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Ohhh I see! I managed to get it to work. Thank you for the help! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]DramaticBox 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)apparently, metrics.gfycat.com is on a list of tracking sites or something according to ublock. I seem to be able to use the site without thisisunsafeing it though. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]Fit-Pie-6984 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)it's not working can someone fix gfycat there's a certain gif I like permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]Kaju_researcher 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Is there a way to access your account without the password? cause it seems I can’t log in anymore. Asking for a password reset doesn’t seem to work. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]rockstarsheep 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Looks like all the gifs are gone. The method works, but I can't see anything. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]PowerOhene 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago* (0 children)I can't either ​ I cannot see, or log inn :/ I have the option to log inn now, but it says the password is wrong - and there is no "forgotten password" button ​ edit: it worked now, thank you op 😭 permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]savannah-mohegan 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago* (1 child)I can go on the site with this method but i can no longer see any gifs on the site or access my page, sadly everything is gone :( RIP EDIT: After a lot of refreshing and trying different browsers and i guess getting lucky, i was able to access my account and quickly downloaded all my fav gifs.

Enter the URL for your account - https://gfycat.com/@YourUserNameHere, then open each gif in a separate tab or window. Once the page loads, right-click the video to save it. (You can even save the image from the preview grid if you want.) Some pages didn't load of course, and you may need to reload a couple of times.

I also found the 'thisisunsafe' from stack overflow after a google, but I had no clue you had to do it for all of those links other than just gfycat. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 4 points5 points6 points 7 months ago (0 children)Gfycat uses these subdomains under the hood, some of them can be visible in the network inspector tool. Also I developed some tools for gfycat, I know its API for quite some time permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Lucky_Morning_4131 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (3 children)This allows me to properly access gifs by browsing through gfycat which is great, but I wonder if you also have a way to access links directly? For example, I can now access a gif, but if I copy paste the gif link into a new tab it just gives me a page not found error. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (2 children)Yes, it seems like the website can be accessed only from the homepage (gfycat.com) to be functional. For accessing the gif directly, just paste its "gfyname" into the Gfycat search. For example, gfycat.com/NippyKindLangur -> search for "NippyKindLangur". If the search result redirects you back to Not found error, then you have to clear the cache: Go to the home page - gfycat.com Hard reload by pressing Ctrl+Shift+R (in Chrome) Use search once again permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]XXBEERUSXX 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)I can now access gfycat and my gallery, but I can't access any gifs directly by using the search even after clearing the cache permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]_gaslit_ 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Does this still work? I can access gfycat.com, but NippyKindLangur turns up No Results Found ever after reloading like you said permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]doctorgecko 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)I've been able to get that to work for most subdomains, but I haven't had any luck with zippy or assets.

HSTS stands for HTTP Strict Transport Security. It is a method used by websites to declare that they should only be accessed using a secure connection (HTTPS). permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Nope, in this case, all the traffic still goes through HTTPS protocol, web browsers are only denying the requests because of expired certificate. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]SK0215 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (2 children)This is gonna seem like such a stupid question because I am not a computer person at all but what do you mean exactly for step 3 (typing “thisisunsafe”)? Where else on the warning page other than the URL bar is there to type on? For me, when I click those links in the bottom, a page pops up that says “Your connection is not private…blah blah blah” and I can click either “learn more”, “advanced”, or “reload”. There is nowhere for me to type anything on this page… Or did you mean I have to open up the code for the warning page and type “thisisunsafe” somewhere on there? Sorry for the dumb question but I am just so confused right now. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Exactly, there is nowhere to type but it works, try it! You don't have to click anything, just have this tab focused. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]SK0215 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Ohhh I see! I managed to get it to work.

Downloading other users profiles it'll only download public gfys. Downloading a collection will download all the gfys in the collection. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]doctorgecko 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago* (0 children)Where do you get the authentication key?

Enter the URL for your account - https://gfycat.com/@YourUserNameHere, then open each gif in a separate tab or window. Once the page loads, right-click the video to save it. (You can even save the image from the preview grid if you want.) Some pages didn't load of course, and you may need to reload a couple of times. Happy hunting! permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]impactmirror 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (0 children)I want to say thank you so much for this. Couldn't find my original files and I was gonna be so sad but managed to save my 130+ gifs this way. You're a lifesaver. Bummed about gfycat but at least I have my gifs back. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]Apo996 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (3 children)Hello guys.., I just the guide, and I know it sounds stupid, but I dont really get the step > "type it anywhere" I mean, on the blank white screen I cant type anything, so where am I suppose to type it ?Anywhere in the code, when I open inspect of the page? thanks for helping! :) permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Anywhere on that Chrome warning page, there is nowhere to type, you won't see typed letters unless you type the whole phrase and the page will refresh itself. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]XXBEERUSXX 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Just type it, you don't need to click anywhere permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Apo996 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)ohhh I see.. holy sh*t, just type it straight away, got it thanks! didnt even know that it can work like this :D permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]sussoutthemoon 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (0 children)I was able to get on the site but could not log in. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]HailSithis201 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)I can view my page but how can I scrub the stuff from my profile without manually download everything? I saw someone shared something about using Python but I’m terrible with code. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]Lucky_Morning_4131 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Wow how'd you figure this out? I also found the 'thisisunsafe' from stack overflow after a google, but I had no clue you had to do it for all of those links other than just gfycat. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 4 points5 points6 points 7 months ago (0 children)Gfycat uses these subdomains under the hood, some of them can be visible in the network inspector tool. Also I developed some tools for gfycat, I know its API for quite some time permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Lucky_Morning_4131 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (3 children)This allows me to properly access gifs by browsing through gfycat which is great, but I wonder if you also have a way to access links directly? For example, I can now access a gif, but if I copy paste the gif link into a new tab it just gives me a page not found error. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 2 points3 points4 points 7 months ago (2 children)Yes, it seems like the website can be accessed only from the homepage (gfycat.com) to be functional. For accessing the gif directly, just paste its "gfyname" into the Gfycat search. For example, gfycat.com/NippyKindLangur -> search for "NippyKindLangur". If the search result redirects you back to Not found error, then you have to clear the cache: Go to the home page - gfycat.com Hard reload by pressing Ctrl+Shift+R (in Chrome) Use search once again permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]XXBEERUSXX 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)I can now access gfycat and my gallery, but I can't access any gifs directly by using the search even after clearing the cache permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]_gaslit_ 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Does this still work? I can access gfycat.com, but NippyKindLangur turns up No Results Found ever after reloading like you said permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]doctorgecko 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)I've been able to get that to work for most subdomains, but I haven't had any luck with zippy or assets. I type thisisunsafe repeatedly and nothing happens permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Gfycat should work without these subdomains permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]Kaju_researcher 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Thanks, how long will this work for before it shuts down for real? permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]reject_wannabecuck 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)This seems to no longer be working, for me at least.

HSTS stands for HTTP Strict Transport Security. It is a method used by websites to declare that they should only be accessed using a secure connection (HTTPS). permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Nope, in this case, all the traffic still goes through HTTPS protocol, web browsers are only denying the requests because of expired certificate. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]SK0215 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (2 children)This is gonna seem like such a stupid question because I am not a computer person at all but what do you mean exactly for step 3 (typing “thisisunsafe”)? Where else on the warning page other than the URL bar is there to type on? For me, when I click those links in the bottom, a page pops up that says “Your connection is not private…blah blah blah” and I can click either “learn more”, “advanced”, or “reload”. There is nowhere for me to type anything on this page… Or did you mean I have to open up the code for the warning page and type “thisisunsafe” somewhere on there? Sorry for the dumb question but I am just so confused right now. permalinkembedsavereportreply[–]chopeY[S] 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (1 child)Exactly, there is nowhere to type but it works, try it! You don't have to click anything, just have this tab focused. permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]SK0215 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)Ohhh I see! I managed to get it to work. Thank you for the help! permalinkembedsaveparentreportreply[–]DramaticBox 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (0 children)apparently, metrics.gfycat.com is on a list of tracking sites or something according to ublock.

There is nowhere for me to type anything on this page… Or did you mean I have to open up the code for the warning page and type “thisisunsafe” somewhere on there? Sorry for the dumb question but I am just so confused right now. permalinkembedsavereportreply [–]SK0215 1 point2 points3 points 7 months ago (2 children) This is gonna seem like such a stupid question because I am not a computer person at all but what do you mean exactly for step 3 (typing “thisisunsafe”)?
