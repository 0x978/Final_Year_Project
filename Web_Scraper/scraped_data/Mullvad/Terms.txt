 Last updated: July 7, 2023 To protect ourselves, our customers, and the quality of our service, we block TCP port 25 because of email spam and ports 137, 138, 139, and 445 due to a Microsoft security issue. We also hijack DNS requests (port 53) in order to prevent DNS leaks. We do not block or filter domains except when requested by the owner of an IP address or when known botnet addresses cause our servers to be null-routed by hosting providers. We do not modify, redirect, or inject data into users' traffic. To use the service, you need to use a Mullvad account number together with the Mullvad VPN app, or with another WireGuard® or OpenVPN client and our downloadable configuration files. The cost for the service is €5 per month. An account can be used on up to 5 devices. Please be sure to write down your account number in a safe place, since the account number is the only confirmation to prove you have the right to use the service and exercise your right to refund. We accept payment by cash in bills (EUR, USD, GBP, SEK, DKK, NOK, CHF, CAD, AUD, NZD) sent by regular mail, Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, credit card, SEPA, PayPal, iOS in-app purchases, our Mullvad vouchers, and Swish. One month is equal to €5 when purchased directly from mullvad.net. The price may vary when purchasing through the App Store or an official reseller. The service is activated as soon as the payment is credited and time starts counting down. These terms will expire at the end of the period purchased. If you have a subscription, please cancel the subscription from the account page on http://mullvad.net (select Unsubscribe under the PayPal/Card tab). Subscription services will soon be terminated. We do not offer refunds for cash and crypto payments. Refund requests for purchases made through the App Store or a reseller must be made directly with them. Mullvad VPN reserves the right to modify the service by updating the software or making changes to certain features. We will attempt to prevent interruptions and defects in the service and on our website. Despite our best efforts, the service is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, and we do not guarantee that the service will be available at all times, nor the accuracy of the service or any material provided by the service or on the Mullvad website. You are solely responsible for your use of the service. The terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of Sweden. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with the terms shall be handled by the National Board for Consumer Disputes (ARN) or the Swedish courts, with the city of Gothenburg's district court as the court of first instance.
