This Policy applies when you visit the Sites and/or use our related services (the “Services”). Please read the following information carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we treat it. MUST READ SECTIONS (EEA RESIDENTS): We draw your attention in particular to the sections entitled “International Data Transfer” and “Your Rights.” CHANGES TO THIS POLICY: We will post any modifications or changes to the Policy on our Sites. We reserve the right to modify the Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently. The “Last Updated” date above indicates when this Policy was last changed. If we make any material change(s) to the Policy, we will post a notice on our Sites prior to such changes(s) taking effect. We collect information about you in a range of forms, including personal data that includes information which, either alone or in combination with other information we hold about you, identifies you as an individual. This includes, for example, your name, postal address, email address(es), and telephone number(s). We will only process your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We need certain personal data in order to provide you with access to our Services. If you create a profile/register with us, you will be asked to agree to provide this information in order to access the Services. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this Policy, please do not use our Services. We collect information about you in the following ways: This includes: We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, if you are part of an organization that has an agreement with us for the use of our Services, we may receive some identifiable information from the organization, such as your name, title, email address(es), and phone number(s). We may add this to information provided by you. We automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Services. For example, when visiting our Services, we log your computer or mobile device operating system name and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, browser language, screen resolution, the website you visited before browsing our Sites, pages you viewed on the Sites, how long you spent on each page, and other related information about your use of and actions with respect to our Services. We collect this information about you using tracking technologies such as “cookies.” Please refer to the sections on cookies and tracking technologies below. We do not generally use your personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making. However, we may do so in order to fulfil obligations imposed by law, or as part of preserving the security of our Sites, in which case we will inform you of any such processing and provide you with an opportunity to object. We may collect information using tracking technologies such as “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites. We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, issued directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are issued by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help,” “tools,” or “edit” facilities). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. NOTE: Many of our Sites will not function unless cookies are enabled, and you may be prevented from accessing a Site until cookies are enabled. We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites to track the actions of users of our Services. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags may be linked to your personal data. We currently do not use other companies to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the Services. We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal data with other parties without your express consent. We may use your personal data as follows: We may share your personal data as follows: When we use the term “anonymous data,” we are referring to data and information that does not permit you to be identified or identifiable, either alone or when combined with any other information available to a third party. We may create anonymous data from the personal data we receive about you and other individuals whose personal data we collect. Anonymous data might include analytics information and information collected by us using cookies or other tracking technologies. We convert personal data into anonymous data by excluding information (such as your name), and modifying any other elements that are reasonably likely to make the data personally identifiable. We use this anonymous data to analyze usage patterns in order to make improvements to our Sites and Services. If you provide feedback to us, we may use and disclose such feedback on our Sites, provided we do not associate such feedback with your personal data or other identifying information. If you have provided your consent to do so, we may, with your approval, post your first and last name along with your feedback about our Services on our Sites. Your information, including personal data that we collect from you, may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us and our affiliates and other third parties outside the country in which you reside, including, but not limited to the United States, where data protection and privacy regulations may not offer the same level of protection as in other parts of the world. By using our Services, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. If you are a resident of the EEA, you will be required to confirm your acceptance of such transfer, storing or processing when you create your user account. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. Please check your account settings to confirm that you have selected the security profile that best suits your needs. We will only retain your personal data for as long reasonably required for us to provide you with our Services or until you close your account/cancel your subscription, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (for example for regulatory purposes), or as required by the sponsoring organization paying for your access to our Services. Subject to the following paragraph, we ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal data (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through our Sites or otherwise to us. We do not actively collect sensitive personal data. If you send or disclose any sensitive personal data to us when you submit user generated content to our Services, you consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data in accordance with this Policy. If you do not consent to our processing and use of such sensitive personal data, you must not submit such user generated content to our Services. If you wish to exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact information in Section 18 below. In your request, please make clear: (i) what personal data is concerned; and (ii) which of the above rights you would like to enforce. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the personal data associated with the name and particular email address(es) that you use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable and in any event, within one month of your request. Please note that we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting such change or deletion.
