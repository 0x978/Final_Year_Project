Our Data Protection Officer (Privacy Officer) can be contacted at privacy@citiprogram.org. MUST READ SECTIONS (EEA RESIDENTS): We draw your attention in particular to the sections entitled “International Data Transfer” and “Your Rights.” CHANGES TO THIS POLICY: We will post any modifications or changes to the Policy on our Sites. We reserve the right to modify the Policy at any time, so we encourage you to review it frequently. The “Last Updated” date above indicates when this Policy was last changed. If we make any material change(s) to the Policy, we will post a notice on our Sites prior to such changes(s) taking effect. 1. Purposes of Processing What is personal data? We collect information about you in a range of forms, including personal data that includes information which, either alone or in combination with other information we hold about you, identifies you as an individual. This includes, for example, your name, postal address, email address(es), and telephone number(s). Why do we need your personal data? We will only process your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. We need certain personal data in order to provide you with access to our Services. If you create a profile/register with us, you will be asked to agree to provide this information in order to access the Services. This consent provides us with the legal basis we require under applicable law to process your data. You maintain the right to withdraw such consent at any time. If you do not agree to our use of your personal data in line with this Policy, please do not use our Services. 2. Collecting Your Personal Data We collect information about you in the following ways: Information You Give Us This includes: the personal data you provide when you register to use our Services, including your‎ name, postal address, email address(es), telephone number(s), username, password and demographic information (such as your gender); the personal data you provide when you report a problem with our Services or when we provide you with customer support; the personal data you provide when you make a purchase thorough our Sites; and the personal data you provide when you correspond with us by phone, email, or by other means. Information We Get from Others We may also obtain information about you from other sources. For example, if you are part of an organization that has an agreement with us for the use of our Services, we may receive some identifiable information from the organization, such as your name, title, email address(es), and phone number(s). We may add this to information provided by you. Information Automatically Collected We automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Services. For example, when visiting our Services, we log your computer or mobile device operating system name and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, browser language, screen resolution, the website you visited before browsing our Sites, pages you viewed on the Sites, how long you spent on each page, and other related information about your use of and actions with respect to our Services. We collect this information about you using tracking technologies such as “cookies.” Please refer to the sections on cookies and tracking technologies below. Automated Decision Making and Profiling We do not generally use your personal data for the purposes of automated decision-making. However, we may do so in order to fulfil obligations imposed by law, or as part of preserving the security of our Sites, in which case we will inform you of any such processing and provide you with an opportunity to object. 3. Cookies and Related Tracking Technologies What are cookies? We may collect information using tracking technologies such as “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Sites. We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, issued directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are issued by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites. Cookies we use Type of cookie Purpose Essential Cookies These cookies are essential to provide you with Services available through our Sites and to enable you to use their features fully. For example, they allow you to log in to secure areas of our Sites. Without these cookies, the Services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those Services. Functionality Cookies These cookies allow us to remember choices you make when you visit our Sites, such as remembering your language preferences, and remembering your login details. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-enter your preferences every time you use our Services. Analytics and Performance Cookies These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Sites and how users use Services. The information gathered does not identify any individual visitor, though it includes IP addresses that can be used to do so. It includes the number of visitors to each Site, the websites that referred them to that Site, the pages visited and for how long, the time of day of that session, whether this is a new or repeat visit, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Sites more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information, and to monitor the level of utilization of all our Services. Social Media Cookies These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button related to our Services, or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as Facebook, Google+, LinkedIn or Twitter. The social media site will record that you have done this. Disabling cookies You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help,” “tools,” or “edit” facilities). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings. NOTE: Many of our Sites will not function unless cookies are enabled, and you may be prevented from accessing a Site until cookies are enabled. Further information about cookies, including which cookies we use, how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, see our Cookie FAQ and Cookie Listing in the CITI Program Support Center. 4. Pixel Tags and Related Tracking Technologies We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Sites to track the actions of users of our Services. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Services, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags may be linked to your personal data. 5. Advertising We currently do not use other companies to serve third-party advertisements when you visit and use the Services. We may use Remarketing with Google Analytics, Facebook, or other social media remarketing tools to advertise online. This enables third-party vendors, including Google and Facebook, to show our ads on sites across the Internet. Such third-party vendors, may use first-party cookies and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our Site. These remarketing tools do not identify you to use personally unless you respond to an advertisement that you received directly from the service. For information on how you can opt out of a third-party vendor’s use of cookies for interest-based ads please visit the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page or control the use of your device identifiers by using your device’s settings options. 6. Using Your Personal Data We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal data with other parties without your express consent.

You may opt-out of receiving such information at any time: such marketing emails tell you how to “opt-out.” Please note, even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you non-marketing emails. Non-marketing emails include those about your account with us (if you have one) and our business dealings with you; to process payments for our Services that you make via our Sites; to link or combine user information with other personal data; as we believe necessary or appropriate (a) to comply with applicable laws; (b) to comply with lawful requests and legal process, including to respond to requests from public and government authorities; (c) to enforce our policies; and (d) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others who use our Services; and as described in the “Sharing of Your Personal Data” section below. 7.

Cookies and Related Tracking Technologies What are cookies? We may collect information using tracking technologies such as “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website.

We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, issued directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Services; and (2) third party cookies, which are issued by service providers on our Sites, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.
