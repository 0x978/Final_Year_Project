Additionally, you will be able to review your purchase history from our web store provider. In Account Settings, you are also able to link a bank card for easy purchases of additional Kaspersky products and services. If you activate this option, our web store provider will attach your bank card data with your account and keep it for future orders. Kaspersky will establish a special link to your web store provider account and will place orders on your behalf whenever they are performed by you. Our web store provider also gives us the information about expiration date of your bank card and the last 4 symbols of your bank card number. However, we will have no access to other data of your credit card stored by our web store provider. The linkage to your account will only be established technically by an internal User ID and password combination.

To configure your connection to Exchange Online or OneDrive, you will be redirected to the Microsoft Online website and prompted to grant permission for the Kaspersky Security for Office 365 application through the OAuth 2.0 flow. The Kaspersky Security for Microsoft Office 365 service also requires a Service Account to access Exchange Online quarantine. This Service Account can be configured automatically or manually. If you choose automatic configuration, the service asks you for Global Admin credentials. The Service does not save this data in any form, but instead uses it only for the initial configuration and creation of a Service Account. If you choose manual configuration, Global Admin credentials are not required, and the Service Account is created manually by the administrator. Support. If you request support from our Customer Service using our Customer Service services, we will ask you for the information that we need in order to help you, such as your registration/license number, the last 4 characters of your bank card number used for purchasing the license, email address, data of the product and service related to your problem, information about your computer hardware and software, and the nature of the problem you are experiencing.

The company employee who first registers the company and a personal account is typically designated as the Administrator. Account settings. You can at any time view, update, correct your account information and password, or delete your account on the "My account" tab. Your company's Kaspersky CompanyAccount Administrator will also be able to change your account settings and reset your password.
