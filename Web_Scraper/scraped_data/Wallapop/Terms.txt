We have updated our Terms and Conditions so you have a better experience using Wallapop:  Last revision: 13 September 2023 Thanks for using Wallapop. Right now you are in a very important space: our Terms and Conditions of Use which, together with the special conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookies Policy, Legal Notice, and current regulations, regulate our relationship. We don’t expect you to find it fun, but at least intelligible, useful, practical, and complete. At Wallapop, we strive to help our community understand the legal conditions that establish the rules of our relationship, while acknowledging the increasing complexity of the applicable laws. These Terms and Conditions of Use (“Terms and Conditions“) define the conditions under which users may access Wallapop’s websites, services, and applications (the “Service“). Use of the Service confers the status of User (the “User“) and implies full acceptance of these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree with all or part of these Terms and Conditions, do not install and/or use the Service. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, you express: The acceptance of these Terms and Conditions by the User is an essential step prior to use of the Service. Wallapop reserves the right to update and/or modify the Terms and Conditions at any time and for any reason in its sole discretion. Wallapop will notify Users of any material changes to the Terms and Conditions or the Service. By accessing or using the Services after Wallapop has notified the User of a modification or update, the User agrees to be bound by the modified Terms and Conditions. If the modified Terms and Conditions are not acceptable to the User, the User must cease using the Services. 1.- Definitions 2.- Introduction 2.1.- Service Holder The owner and proprietor of the Service is Wallapop, S.L. (“Wallapop“), with registered offices at Avenida Meridiana 89, 6ª planta, C.P. 08026, Barcelona (Spain), with tax identification number B-66049057, incorporated on May 23, 2013 before the Notary Public Mr. Rafael de Córdoba Benedito, and registered in the Barcelona Mercantile Registry, Volume 46767, Folio 149, Page B-438613, 1st Inscription. 2.2.- The Service Wallapop is an online marketplace provider that offers an electronic community platform where Users can post ads, access these ads and their contents, and have the opportunity to make purchases and sales. Wallapop solely offers a space for community interaction. Wallapop does not under any circumstances sell or buy goods, nor does it provide the services advertised. Wallapop is basically an ad publication service that connects advertisers and interested parties so that they can conduct transactions, when possible, involving the goods and services offered on Wallapop. 2.3.- Registration requirement In order to use the Service, the User must first register and accept these Terms and Conditions, the special conditions mentioned, and the Privacy Policy. You must also decide whether or not to accept the use of nonessential Cookies. The data you enter must be accurate, current, and truthful. As a registered User, you are responsible at all times for the safekeeping of your password, thus assuming any damages that might arise from its misuse, transfer, disclosure, or loss. You must immediately inform Wallapop if you have reason to believe that your password has been or is likely to be used in an unauthorized manner. Under no circumstances is Wallapop responsible for the safekeeping and use of User accounts. 3.- Service terms of use 3.1.- The User agrees to use the Service in compliance with the law, moral standards, public order, and these Terms and Conditions. The User also agrees to make appropriate use of the Service and not use it for illegal or criminal activities that infringe on the rights of third parties or violate any rule of law. 3.2.- The User agrees not to transmit, introduce, disseminate, and/or make available to third parties any type of material or information (products, objects, data, content, messages, drawings, sound and image files, photographs, software, etc.) that violates the law, moral standards, public order, or these Terms and Conditions. These restrictions on User behavior include, but are not limited to, the following: 3.3.- The User agrees to indemnify Wallapop against any possible claim, fine, penalty, or sanction the User may be obliged to bear as a consequence of the User’s non-compliance with any of the above-mentioned rules of use, and Wallapop reserves the right to seek compensation for any corresponding damages. 4.- Responsibility 4.1.- Wallapop is a company that solely acts as an intermediary between the Seller and the Buyer. Therefore, Wallapop does not own any of the Items for sale or sold through its platform and is not a party to the sales and purchase transactions carried out exclusively between Buyers and Sellers, nor does it review or validate the Items that Users offer through the Service. Consequently, Wallapop shall not be directly, indirectly, or subsidiarily liable for damages of any nature arising from the use and contracting of the content and activities offered by Users and/or third parties through the Service, nor for their lack of legality, reliability, usefulness, truthfulness, accuracy, completeness, or timeliness. Wallapop acts solely as an online marketplace provider and under no circumstances forms part of the contractual relationship that may occur between the Seller and the Buyer. Accordingly, the Users bear full responsibility for complying with any tax obligations arising from transactions carried out through the platform. In particular, it is the responsibility of Professional Users carrying out business or professional activity as Sellers of products and/or services on Wallapop to issue and forward invoices to Users who purchase goods, as well as to comply with the tax obligations arising from such transactions. Under no circumstances shall it be understood that Wallapop acts or operates as a merchant or (re)seller of the goods and/or services marketed through its platform. 4.2.- Wallapop therefore shall not be liable for damages of any nature arising from instances including, but not limited to, the following: 4.3.- Wallapop shall be solely and exclusively liable to the User for the Services it provides directly to the User (Visibility Service and Subscription Service). 4.4.- Users must comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations when using the Website. 4.5.- Wallapop reserves the right to block the accounts of Users by temporarily or permanently restricting access to the Service to any User who violates any of the rules set forth in these Terms and Conditions, the law, moral standards, or public order. For example, in Portugal, in accordance with Article 80-A of the Value Added Tax Code, Wallapop reserves the right to freeze the activity of platform Users by blocking their accounts if they do not comply with their tax obligations and have not rectified their situation by providing the appropriate supporting documentation to Wallapop. 4.6.- Users are fully responsible for all the information they publish, include in, or transmit through the Website, as well as for the Items they offer, sell, or transfer to other Users. By accepting these Terms and Conditions, Users acknowledge and agree that they are fully responsible for any Item or ad uploaded to the platform, the information provided via the description, photographs, and statements made to buyers or other Users, and the accuracy of other details provided. In addition, Users are exclusively responsible for transactions made with other Users and any resulting disputes. 4.7.- Consumer Users are informed that some advertisers who offer goods and services on Wallapop are considered to be businesspeople, and are thus categorized as Professional Users. You can identify these Professional Users by checking their profiles and verifying that they include the designation “Business Account.” This is relevant because sales and purchases made through Wallapop with Professional Users must comply with Royal Legislative Decree 1/2007, November 16, 2007, which approves the revised text of the General Law for the Protection of Consumers and Users and other supplementary laws (“Consumer Regulations” or “TRLGDCU“). Professional Users must bear in mind when carrying out transactions with Consumer Users the applicable Consumer Regulations and all the rights and obligations therein. For example, Professional Users are responsible for informing Buyers of and managing their right of withdrawal. 4.8.- Consumer Users are informed that those Users who are not identified as “Professional Users” also have the status of Consumer Users. Consequently, Consumer Regulations do not apply in transactions in which the Seller is a Consumer, but the purchase and sale are be governed by the provisions of the Spanish Civil Code. 5.- Content and services linked via the Service 5.1.- The Service may include links, directories, and even search tools that allow the User to access other websites and portals (“Linked Sites“). 5.2.- The User acknowledges and solely accepts the risk and responsibility entailed in accessing Linked Sites, absolving Wallapop of any liability for possible infringement of the intellectual or industrial property rights of the owners of the Linked Sites. The User also absolves Wallapop of any liability for the technical availability of the Linked Sites, as well as the quality, reliability, accuracy and/or veracity of the services, information, elements and/or content to which the User may have access. 5.3.- In such cases, Wallapop shall only be responsible for the content and services provided on the Linked Sites to the extent that it has actual knowledge of the unlawfulness and has not deactivated the link with due diligence. If the User believes that there is a Linked Site with unlawful or inappropriate content, the User may inform Wallapop, without this communication in any case entailing the obligation to remove the corresponding link. 5.4.- Under no circumstances should the existence of Linked Sites presuppose the formalization of agreements with the owners or those responsible for the sites, nor the recommendation, promotion, or identification of Wallapop with the statements, content, or services provided. Wallapop is not aware of the content and services of the Linked Sites and, therefore, is not directly or indirectly liable for damages caused by the unlawfulness, quality, obsoleteness, unavailability, incorrectness, or uselessness of the content and/or services of the Linked Sites, or any other damages that are not directly attributable to Wallapop. 6.- Intellectual and industrial property 6.1.- The industrial and intellectual property rights connected with the protected works, services, and any content or elements to which intellectual and industrial property rights pertain that are used in the Service (the “Contents of the Service“) belong to their legitimate owners. The User shall not acquire by the use of the Service any intellectual or industrial property right, nor any license of use whatsoever, for such elements. 6.2.- The Contents of the Service include, but are not limited to, the texts, photographs, graphics, images, icons, technology, software, databases, other audiovisual or sound content, and the graphic design and source codes used in the Service. 6.3.- The text, images, graphics, sound files, animation files, video files, software, and appearance of the Wallapop Website are protected by intellectual and industrial property rights. These elements may not be validly and legitimately copied or distributed for commercial use, nor may they be modified or inserted into other websites without the prior express authorization of their owners. 6.4.- The User declares exclusive ownership of all rights pertaining to protected works, services, and any other elements included in the Service that are protected by intellectual or industrial property laws (the “User’s Content“). 6.5.- The User assigns to Wallapop, free of charge and exclusively, the global rights of public communication, reproduction, distribution and transformation of the User’s Content, in all forms of exploitation existing on the date of acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, for the entire duration of the rights assigned. 6.6.- Wallapop does not represent or have any business relationship with the brands that Users may advertise on the Service. 7.- Publication of ads 7.1.- The User may not publish ads violating the law, moral standards, public order, and these Terms and Conditions (for example, the rules of use of the Service included in Section 3 of these terms). Users must take into account the following non-exhaustive list of considerations when publishing their ads: 7.3.- Users interested in purchasing a product must take into account that when they agree to purchase an Item for an established price, they are entering into a contract of sale with another User. Likewise, Users must take into account that when purchasing an Item, they will be subject to the Tax on Property Transfer and Legal Documents (“ITPAJD“), according to TPO provisions, being obliged to hold Wallapop completely harmless in the event of not complying with said obligation. 7.4.- Users who publish a rental ad in some municipalities in Catalonia must include the Reference Price Index as required by “Law 11/2020, September 18, on urgent measures to control rental costs in housing leases in Catalonia,” which came into force in September 2020. Wallapop is held fully harmless in case of non-compliance with this obligation. 7.6.- Users are exclusively responsible for ads and Wallapop is not responsible for their content. Wallapop does not monitor the ads that are published. However, Wallapop may delete those ads that violate these Terms and Conditions or the law, either upon complaint by other Users or on Wallapop’s own initiative, if non-compliance is detected. 8.- Information on the search results ranking parameters for ads 8.1.- When a User performs a search, the ads that are included in the search results are classified and displayed based on various criteria. The main factors that determine the search results are outlined below: The criteria that most influence the ranking of ads and their visibility are the Subscription Services and the Visibility Services, which are paid. The specific characteristics of these Services can be found in sections 10 and 11 of these Terms and Conditions. It should be clear that the criteria that most influence the visibility of ads are those services where the user pays for a special publication service. 9.- Filtering ads and User reviews 9.1.- Unless specifically required by law, Wallapop is not under any general obligation to monitor ads or information posted by Users, or to actively seek facts or circumstances that indicate the existence of illegal activities. Accordingly, Wallapop does not play an active role in the agreement or contract between users that grants it knowledge of such information or control over it. Likewise, Wallapop’s filtering, management of the removal of ads, and review and removal of User profiles that do not comply with current regulations or the Terms and Conditions do not imply that it is to be held responsible for the content posted by Users or any other actions of its Users. 9.2.- Once a transaction has been carried out between Users, they will have the opportunity to post a review or assessment of how the transaction went. This assessment may be performed reciprocally, i.e., assessing both the Seller and the Buyer. 9.3.- Users must evaluate other Users completely objectively and truthfully, without using offensive remarks or insults, or showing disrespect. 9.4.- The ratings that appear in each User’s profile are posted by other Users. Wallapop does not control or moderate the content of these reviews, so their content is entirely the responsibility of the Users. Despite the quality processes implemented at Wallapop, we cannot guarantee that the published reviews have been made by Users who have actually used or purchased the goods or services. 9.5.- Wallapop reserves the right to delete any reviews that are false, disrespectful, denigrating and, in general, contrary to good faith, the law, or these Terms and Conditions. Users may inform Wallapop of any suspicions of a fraudulent purchase through the tools available on the Website. 10.- Visibility Service 10.1.- Users may increase the visibility of their ads on Wallapop by contracting Visibility Services. These are optional services that Users may use to improve the positioning of the advertised Items. 10.3.- It is not possible to remove, move, or change the type or duration of a highlight that has already been applied to an ad, regardless of whether the ad is removed by our moderation team or is affected by a technical issue. 10.4.- If a featured ad is deleted or marked as sold and the contracted period has not yet ended, the excess visibility time will be lost. 10.5.- If the Item is sold using Wallapop’s shipping service, the ad will be marked as sold automatically when the package is delivered to the Buyer so that if the contracted period had not yet ended, the excess visibility time will be lost. 10.7.- The prices and durations of the available highlights may vary as they depend on several factors, such as the type of Item being promoted, its popularity, or the area in which you want to promote it. If Wallapop makes significant changes in the operation of the highlights, you will be notified in advance so that you can change the contracted service or terminate the contract. 10.8.- Users are always informed about the chosen Visibility Service before finalizing the purchase. 10.9.- Visibility Services that have been applied to an ad or a profile cannot be refunded regardless of the publication status of the ad or whether the profile is active or inactive. 10.10.- In case of failure in the application of a Visibility Service contracted through the Website due to a technical incident, the User shall be entitled to terminate the Visibility Service contract with the right to reimbursement of the purchase cost. In this regard, the deadline for requesting reimbursement is 14 calendar days from the purchase of the highlight. 10.11.- Wallapop may charge for editing or reactivating an ad in certain versions of the app or the website. In these instances, the User will always be duly informed of the cost of the service before confirming the purchase. The User will always have the option to refuse the service at no cost. 10.12.- If the location of a profile is changed, the ads featured prior to the making of the change will appear on the wall for the new area but will remain in the carousel (the section in the app that shows a selection of Items) and in the collection of featured ads for the location specified when the service was contracted. 10.14.- The prices for the Visibility Service include a 21% Value Added Tax. In those cases in which this tax rate is not applicable under the tax localization rules established in the Value Added Tax Law 37/1992 of December 28, 1992, Wallapop agrees to adjust the tax rate. 10.15.- Please be aware that the exercise of the right of withdrawal is not applicable to purchase of the Visibility Service.

Copyright © 2023 Wallapop, S.L. Last revision: 3 May 2023 According to the European Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services (hereinafter, “P2B Regulation”), if you are a business user on Wallapop you have a series of rights and obligations that you must know. Before being informed of these rights and obligations, you must know what should be understood as a business user to determine if these Terms and Conditions for Business Users (hereinafter, the “Conditions”) apply to you or not. In this regard, we will help you with the following definition: according to the current regulation, a “business user” is considered to be any private individual acting within the framework of a commercial or professional activity or any legal entity (e.g. a company, foundation, or association) that offers goods or services to consumer users through our platform for purposes relating to their trade, business, craft, or profession (hereinafter, “Business User”). According to the abovementioned P2B Regulation, there are several definitions that can be of your interest as a Business User in order to properly understand these Conditions. Without limitation, the following definitions are highlighted: – “Online intermediation services” means services which constitute information society services; allow Business Users to offer goods or services to consumers, with a view to facilitating the initiation of direct transactions between those Business Users and consumers, irrespective of where those transactions are ultimately concluded; and are provided to Business Users on the basis of contractual relationships between the provider of those services and Business Users which offer goods or services to consumers. – “Provider of online intermediation services” means any natural or legal person which provides, or which offers to provide, online intermediation services to Business Users. In these Conditions, the Provider of online intermediation services is Wallapop. – “Consumer” means any natural person who is acting for purposes which are outside this person’s trade, business, craft or profession. – “Ranking” means the relative prominence given to the goods or services offered through online intermediation services (such as those provided by Wallapop), organised, or communicated by the Providers of online intermediation services, irrespective of the technological means used for such presentation, organisation or communication. This is the criteria used by Wallapop to post on its platform the user’s advertisements. – “Mediation” means a structured process whereby two or more parties to a dispute attempt by themselves, on a voluntary basis, to reach an agreement on the settlement of their dispute with the assistance of a mediator. – “Durable medium” means any instrument which enables Business Users to store information addressed personally to them in a way accessible for future reference and for a period of time adequate for the purposes of the information and allows the unchanged reproduction of the information stored. P2B Regulation and these Conditions are applicable both to Wallapop and to you if you are a Business User. They are therefore legally binding. Wallapop shall notify Business Users in a durable medium of any proposed content modifications to these Conditions. The proposed modifications shall not be implemented before the end of the notification period, which shall be reasonable and proportionate with respect to the nature and extent of the intended changes as well as the consequences for the Business User. The notice period shall be at least fifteen (15) days from the date on which Wallapop communicates the proposed changes. Longer periods shall be provided where necessary to allow Business Users to make technical or commercial adjustments to comply with the modifications. The Business User affected by such changes shall have the right to terminate the contract before the expiry of the notice period. Such termination shall be effective within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of the notice, unless a shorter period applies to the contract. The Business User affected may waive the notice period, either in writing or by clear affirmative action, at any time after receipt of the notice. During the notice period, the offer of new goods or services shall be deemed a clear affirmative action to waive the notice period, except in cases where the notice period is longer than fifteen (15) days. The fifteen (15) day notice period shall not apply where Wallapop: Wallapop shall not impose retroactive modifications to the Conditions, except where it must comply with a legal or regulatory obligation or where retroactive modifications are beneficial to Business Users. There are a number of circumstances which may lead to the restriction, suspension or termination of the Services of your Wallapop account as a Business User. Your account Services may be suspended in the following cases: The suspension or restriction of the Services of the Business User account implies that you will not be able to access the advertisements published on the Wallapop platform for the duration of the suspension or that you will not be able to access the advertisements that have been disabled. When you solve the issue after Wallapop has notified you of this suspension or restriction/disabling of the advertisement(s), you will be able to access your Business User account or the disabled advertisement(s) again and, if applicable, publish the advertisement(s) again. In these cases of suspension, restriction, or disabling of advertisements, Wallapop will notify you beforehand or simultaneously about the action to be taken on your account or your advertisements. Specifically, Wallapop will send you a written communication indicating the reasons for the suspension or restriction of Services. The communication may be sent via the email address provided by you when registering as a Business User or by any other means that is considered to be a durable medium. The suspension or restriction of the Services or the removal of advertisements due to these reasons shall not give rise to any right to compensation or remuneration that you may claim from Wallapop. In the event of temporary suspension, restriction or disabling, you may use the dispute resolution system set up by Wallapop for Business Users. This system has been set up to manage possible claims and discrepancies that may arise between Wallapop and you during the provision of the Services linked to your account. You can obtain more information about this system in clauses 9 and 10 of these Conditions. In case of restriction or suspension, Wallapop gives the Business User the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances within the framework of the internal complaint handling procedure. When the restriction or suspension is revoked by Wallapop, it shall without undue delay reinstate the Business User, including with regard to access to personal or other data that was generated by their use of the Services before the restriction or suspension took effect. We inform you that in certain cases Wallapop may proceed to the early termination of the Service contract linked to your Business User account. The following are causes for early termination of the provision of Services linked to your account: In the event of early termination of the Services linked to the Business User’s account due to a manifest infringement by Wallapop, you may be entitled to a refund of the proportional part already paid for such Services in advance. The early termination of the Services does not extinguish or modify the rights and obligations of the Business Users or Wallapop arising prior to the early termination of the Services. In other words, invoices issued or to be issued for Services provided by Wallapop up to the effective date of termination shall be deemed due and payable and shall be passed on to the Business User. If Wallapop terminates all of the Business User’s Services, it shall provide the Business User, at least thirty (30) days before the termination takes effect, with a statement of the reasons justifying the decision on a durable medium. This period shall not apply when Wallapop (neither the written statement): In the event of termination of the Services, as a Business User you have a migration period of thirty (30) additional calendar days from the end of the contracted period of Services. Or, in the event of non-compliance, you shall have the aforementioned thirty (30) day period, which shall commence with the notification announcing the termination. During this period of time, you may download the information and content generated on the Wallapop platform. After this period of time, Wallapop will definitively remove all the content that you have generated as a Business User from its database and will definitively close your Business User account. During the time periods provided for in this section, you can use the available dispute resolution and complaints system. More information about this complaints system can be found in clauses 9 and 10. In the event of termination, Wallapop offers the Business User the opportunity to clarify the facts and circumstances within the framework of the internal complaint handling procedure. When the termination is revoked by Wallapop, it shall without undue delay reinstate the Business User, including with regard to access to personal or other data, or both, that was generated by his or her use of the Services before the restriction or suspension took effect. The ranking and visibility of advertisements on Wallapop is carried out based on different criteria such as: The criteria that have the greatest impact on the ranking of advertisements and their visibility are paid subscriptions and featured advertisements, which are also paid. The characteristics of subscriptions and featured advertisements are described in the descriptions of such Services located in the help center on the Wallapop website. It should be clear that the criteria that influence the visibility of advertisements the most are those services where the user pays for a special publication service. Wallapop will maintain and periodically update the variations that may occur in the criteria for the classification of advertisements on its platform. We have set up a free internal complaints handling system to ensure that as a Business User you have a channel through which you can send us complaints. It is everyone’s responsibility to ensure that this channel is useful and can resolve complaints within a reasonable period of time. As a Business User, you will be able to file a complaint in these cases: Once we receive a complaint, we will analyse it with the utmost diligence. In doing so, we will take into account the relevance of the problem raised and the specific circumstances of each case. We will provide you with a reasoned response on the outcome of the procedure in an understandable and individualised written notification. Please note that during the resolution of the complaint, we may maintain the decision to suspend, restrict or terminate the Service early and, after the complaint has been resolved, measures may be taken to reverse the situation if necessary. We also inform you that as a Business User you may at any time initiate a legal complaint if you deem it appropriate, whether or not the internal complaint procedure has been resolved. In order to improve the processes, we undertake to verify, at least annually, the correct functioning of this system and, if necessary, make the appropriate changes to improve its effectiveness. If any changes are made to its operation, we will inform you about the amendment of these Conditions. Once the complaint has been received, it will be dealt with internally. Each complaint will be reviewed by a group of Wallapop professionals who will be in charge of resolving it. These professionals will have sufficient knowledge of customer service and of Wallapop’s business model, as well as sufficient legal knowledge to be able to deal with complaints objectively and in accordance with the law. However, remember that you still have the Wallapop customer service system at your disposal for all issues that may not be as complex or do not involve a claim as such. Evaluate what your situation is and which is the ideal channel for an optimal solution to your problem. On behalf of Wallapop we will inform you periodically about the use of this system by publishing information about the use that users make of the complaints system. In particular, we will annually verify the information on the functioning and effectiveness of the complaint system and, where significant modifications are necessary, update this information. This information will specify: If, despite submitting a complaint and once it has been resolved, you still consider that we have not resolved the dispute, you can access mediation systems to try to resolve the dispute out of court. In accordance with the above, Wallapop will provide two dispute resolution mediators whose actions will meet the following requirements: Accordingly, Wallapop provides access to the following dispute resolution mediators: In addition to the above, other mediation entities of recognised prestige may be appointed. Please note that Wallapop will bear a reasonable part of the costs of mediation in each individual case, but the rest of the costs shall be charged to the Business User who has requested mediation. Finally, we would like to inform you that going to mediation does not remove your right to take legal action, which we can also take. In other words, mediation is an option, not an obligation, and at no time will it limit the rights of either party to effective judicial protection.
