Accordingly, the Users bear full responsibility for complying with any tax obligations arising from transactions carried out through the platform. In particular, it is the responsibility of Professional Users carrying out business or professional activity as Sellers of products and/or services on Wallapop to issue and forward invoices to Users who purchase goods, as well as to comply with the tax obligations arising from such transactions. Under no circumstances shall it be understood that Wallapop acts or operates as a merchant or (re)seller of the goods and/or services marketed through its platform.
