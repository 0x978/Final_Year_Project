Many features of Not the Bee are available without a paid subscription; however, premium access requires you to subscribe. When you purchase a subscription, you agree to pay the applicable subscription fee, as well as any applicable taxes and renewal fees as described more fully below. If we are unable to charge your credit card or other payment method, your subscription will automatically terminate. We may increase the price of Not the Bee subscriptions at any time, however, we will give you at least thirty (30) days advance notice of any price increase. This advance notice will give you an opportunity to cancel your subscription before the price increase goes into effect. If you do not cancel your subscription before the price increase goes into effect, you will be deemed to have agreed to the price increase. If you subscribe to Not the Bee, you agree to keep your contact information (i.e. address, email address, phone number) and payment information up-to-date at all times. The Monthly Subscription provides you with access to exclusive, members-only content and benefits, including—but not limited to—an ad-free experience and access to our full-length podcast. As a subscriber, you may still receive notices of internal promotions, recommended content and bulletins that enhance the user experience. We do not make any guarantees as to the posting or availability of any content. The Monthly Subscription will automatically renew every month around the same day as the purchase date. You must cancel your subscription before the renewal date to prevent the next charge to your credit card or other payment method. We may also choose, in our sole discretion, not to renew your subscription. You may cancel your Monthly Subscription at any time by following the cancellation process above. If you cancel your Monthly Subscription, you will not receive any refund, and your access will continue until the end of the current subscription period. Except as noted in this paragraph, all charges for the Monthly Subscription are non-refundable. The terms for annual and custom subscribers are the same as the Monthly Subscriber above, except that payments are processed on a yearly basis rather than monthly. The cost of a custom subscription is set by you, the subscriber, at the time of checkout. If you would like to make a one-time donation, we would suggest that you sign up as a custom subscriber, and then immediately cancel your account so that you do not continue billing in the future.

Not the Bee DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SITE IN TERMS OF ITS QUALITY, CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. Not the Bee DOES NOT WARRANT THAT ANY PART OF THE SITE WILL OPERATE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SITE OR THE SERVER THAT MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE AND ACCESS TO THE SITE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, CONTINUOUS, OR ERROR-FREE.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES. Any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, the Site, or the relationship of the parties, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of state or federal statutory or common law rights or duties (a “Dispute”) shall be solely and exclusively resolved according to the procedures set forth in this paragraph. If we are unable to resolve any Dispute through informal means, either party may initiate binding arbitration of such Dispute. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the Dispute has arisen, but in no event shall it be made more than one year from when the aggrieved party knew or should have known of the controversy, claim or facts forming the basis of the Dispute. The arbitration shall be initiated and conducted according to the American Arbitration Association Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “Arbitration Rules”). The arbitration shall be conducted in Palm Beach County, Florida before a single neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the arbitrator shall not have the power to award indirect, punitive, special or consequential damages against any party. Arbitration costs and fees shall be determined in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and applicable law. Each party shall be responsible for paying its own attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all of its attorneys’ fees, costs and expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines. No Dispute may be arbitrated on a class or representative basis and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator, if any, may be entered for enforcement purposes in any court having jurisdiction thereof. BY AGREEING TO THESE TERMS, EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO PRESENT A DISPUTE IN COURT, RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS OR DISPUTES WITH THOSE OF OTHERS IN THE FORM OF A CLASS ACTION OR SIMILAR PROCEDURAL DEVICE. The Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to conflicts of laws principles. Not the Bee’s failure to enforce strict performance of any provision of these Terms of Use will not constitute a waiver of Not the Bee’s right to subsequently enforce such a provision or any other provision of these Terms, nor will any delay or omission on the part of Not the Bee to exercise or take advantage of any right or remedy that Not the Bee has or may have hereunder, operate as a waiver of any right or remedy. In the event that any of the provisions of these Terms shall be held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portion hereof shall remain in full force and effect and such a provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the parties and shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make such provisions valid and enforceable. Not the Bee, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to update, revise, supplement and to otherwise modify these Terms of Use, and to impose new or additional terms and conditions on your use of the Site from time to time.
