The data (comments, avatars etc.) are not part of the Pepper&Carrot website, but part of the blog (davidrevoy.com website). So, in the repository open-sourced of Pepper&Carrot, you won't find any personal data relative to the comments on the blog. Pepper&Carrot sources only contains this website's "engine". Therefore, I, David Revoy, am the only responsible for managing your data collected on the mentioned websites. (There is an exception to that about "embedded content from other websites", see below.) When visitors leave comments on the blog (davidrevoy.com), I collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the visitorâ€™s IP address. The website also generate automatically a catavatar picture generated after the name of the commenter. The picture is kept on a cached directory that only the website can read. If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely, saved on a XML file. This is made so the website can recognize and approve any follow-up comments by you automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. Removing a comment or editing is not possible for the user via the web interface because the engine of the website PluXML (used for davidrevoy.com) doesn't allow it. In case you want the modification or deletion of a comment, please just add another comment from the same machine (so I can see your IP, this prevents having someone else wanting to edit or delete your message) and ask David Revoy to edit or remove your comment. I'll do it manually as soon as possible. The website Pepper&Carrot uses a single cookie stored on your webbrowser for one year. This cookie let your webbrowser remember your favorite "bookmark" language, and is totally optional. You can check yourself the content of the cookie by entering this address on the Firefox browser: chrome://browser/content/preferences/cookies.xul, then filter the website by entering peppercarrot. Navigating the website without cookies is not a problem. The blog (davidrevoy.com) uses a session ID stored server side and represented by a temporary file named like a hash. This session ID allow continuity in the page you browse on the website and also allows to send data to the next page. It is used when you send a comment, so the next page can save the file and store it on the server in a XML file (the database of davidrevoy.com is 'flat'; file-based). The session ID expires in less than 24 hours and only have the purpose to be around for a single visit, after that a new one is generated. The comment system doesn't remember your name. If the field to enter a comment already proposes a name or an email, it is done only by your web browser. Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website. (eg. Embeding a Youtube video player). I don't use any analytic services, so I can't sell the data of my visitors to anyone (I don't use Google Analytics or any other scripts that track you, you can check the source code of my page at any moment). The website doesn't do any automated decision based on the profile or on the user data. Pepper&Carrot website and Davidrevoy blog looks the same for all visitors. The layout changing of aspect accross devices is only done with 'Media-Queries'; a built-in CSS function that redirect a set of layout rules depending of the size of the monitor detected. I don't have access to this sizes. The data files (email, name, avatar, IP when you leave while commenting; the log of the website) are protected and the files can be accessed only via FTP/SSH with code access of the server. I am the only person with this access right now. It is not possible to access this directories via public access. As I don't collect any sensible information about our visitors (only IP and email(optional) for the comment system) a big hack of our database wouldn't affect really our end-user. In the worst case, a leak of emails adresses and IPs can happen. No password can be stolen as no password will ever be asked for leaving a comment on www.peppercarrot or davidrevoy.com. In case of getting evidence of impersonation through the comments by impersonating both email and IP, or in case of the modification of the content of your comment by someone else, I have access to moderate the comment. Thank you for reading.
