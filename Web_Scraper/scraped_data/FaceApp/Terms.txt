IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS SECTION 12A OF THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS PROVISIONS GOVERNING HOW DISPUTES THAT YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DISPUTES THAT AROSE OR WERE ASSERTED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, IT CONTAINS AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT WHICH WILL, WITH LIMITED EXCEPTIONS, REQUIRE DISPUTES BETWEEN US TO BE SUBMITTED TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT: (1) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEVE AGAINST US ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING; AND (2) YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO PURSUE DISPUTES OR CLAIMS AND SEEK RELIEF IN A COURT OF LAW AND TO HAVE A JURY TRIAL. IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12B BELOW. IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE US, THE UK OR THE EU, THIS SECTION 12A DOES NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND DISPUTES YOU AND WE HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 12C BELOW. ANY DISPUTE, CLAIM OR REQUEST FOR RELIEF RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS IS EXPRESSLY EXCLUDED FROM THE AGREEMENT. Please read the following section carefully because it requires users to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with FaceApp and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from us. Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Except for small claims disputes in which you or FaceApp seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or FaceApp seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and FaceApp waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or our Services resolved in court. This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions or at another mutually agreed location. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and FaceApp. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND FACEAPP HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and FaceApp are instead electing that all disputes, claims or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief. ALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER USER. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the courts of the Republic of Cyprus. All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated. You and FaceApp agree that the courts of the Republic of Cyprus have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. Severability. Except as provided in this Section 12A, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed, and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Survival of Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with FaceApp. If you are located in the Republic of Cyprus, both you and FaceApp can bring legal proceedings in relation to the Services or this Agreement in the courts of the Republic of Cyprus. If you live outside of the Republic of Cyprus, but within the EU or the UK, then both you and FaceApp can bring legal proceedings in respect of the Services or this Agreement in either your local courts or the courts of the Republic of Cyprus. If you are not located in the US, the EU or the UK then, to the fullest extent permitted by law, both you and we irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Republic of Cyprus in relation to the Services or this Agreement. This Agreement and any disputes, claim or request for relief (including non-contractual disputes) arising out of or in connection with this Agreement and your access to and use of our Services will be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Cyprus, without regard to conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the Republic of Cyprus or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Complaints will be handled in accordance with our complaints handling policy found here. By accessing or using the Services, you also consent to receive electronic communications from FaceApp (e.g., responses to your requests, questions and feedback, announcements, updates, and security alerts through a push notification or by posting notices on the Services).

If any provision or part of a provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from this Agreement and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
