For example, if teams in other locations needed access to cookie data for analytics purposes.

Adequacy decisions: where the European Commission, or other relevant competent authority, has determined that a country outside the EEA or Switzerland offers an adequate level of data protection, personal data may be sent to that third country without implementing any other safeguards mentioned above. YouGov may rely on adequacy decisions when transferring data to companies based in countries where such assurances have been given.

This section describes some of the measures we take to ensure that your personal data is secure: We use data centres that have a high level of physical security measures to host and protect your data and our systems; We conduct independent penetration tests on an annual basis and are continuously scanning our systems and applications for vulnerabilities in our systems; if you ever think that you have found a security issue or vulnerability in one of our systems, please let us know at security@yougov.com; We use encryption to secure your personal data whilst it is in transit using TLS and in storage using AES256 encryption; We allow access to attributable data (by which we mean data that directly identifies you) only to those YouGov employees and contractors who need it to carry out their job responsibilities, for example our support team to allow them to respond to you when you contact us; We make security the responsibility of all our employees and contractors and we train our staff to identify security risks and protect your data.

Who we may share your personal data with In order to use your personal data in the ways described above, we may share it within YouGov and with trusted third parties who provide services to us. Here is some more information about the types of organisation and what we may share with them. YouGov Group companiesYouGov is a global organisation. This means that some of the personal data that we collect may be transferred to companies in the YouGov group that are in different countries. For example, if teams in other locations needed access to cookie data for analytics purposes. Our service providers We work with trusted service providers that carry out certain functions on our behalf so we can provide our services to you. These organisations process data on our behalf. They only have access to the personal data that they absolutely need to provide the specific service to us, and in all cases we have contractual safeguards in place to ensure that they do not disclose or use it for any other purposes. Our service providers fall within the following categories: Cloud & physical data storage (data storage, which is managed by YouGov Services Limited) Web application firewall (protects web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet) Cookie consent management platform (enables us to tell you about and seek consent for our use of cookies) Other organisationsThese circumstances are unusual, but we may share personal data with other organisations if: we have to share your information to comply with legal or regulatory requirements (or we reasonably believe that we need to disclose your information for such purposes); we need to share personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights, including with our legal and other professional advisors; we restructure our business or if we buy or sell any business or assets we may share your data with the prospective buyer or seller; all or substantially all of our company assets are acquired by another party, your data will be one of the transferred assets. Transferring personal data outside the EEA If you are based in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), or Switzerland, we take all steps possible to ensure that your personal data remains within those areas. However, in some cases we need to share data with other YouGov group companies or third parties that are in countries outside those areas. These countries may not have similar data protection laws and so they may not protect the use of your personal information to the same extent. In these cases, we put in place appropriate safeguards to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected. Specifically, we make use of the following: Standard contractual clauses: we use standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to organisations outside the EEA. These contractual commitments have been adopted by the European Commission and ensure adequate protection for personal data transferred to countries outside the EEA by binding recipients of personal data to certain data protection standards including obliging them to apply appropriate technical and security measures. We use standard contractual clauses when we transfer data to other YouGov Group companies and for transfers to recipients that are not located in a country covered by an adequacy decision (see below). Adequacy decisions: where the European Commission, or other relevant competent authority, has determined that a country outside the EEA or Switzerland offers an adequate level of data protection, personal data may be sent to that third country without implementing any other safeguards mentioned above. YouGov may rely on adequacy decisions when transferring data to companies based in countries where such assurances have been given.
