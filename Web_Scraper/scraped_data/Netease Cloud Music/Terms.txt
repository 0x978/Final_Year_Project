If you are interested in NetEase music streaming, check out the NetEase music website for all the latest news and events. The latest version of the app was released on the 8th of July this year. Netease Cloud Music app store is where you can download the app and it will preview what the app will look like for both Android and ios, in terms of features. It is also easy to access a NetEase cloud music download pc version if you want to try this as well. You just need to download it through Chrome. There is a possibility for streaming on multiple devices, but Spotify does this too. The music library is the same for both, however, the language settings will still be roughly 90% Chinese, as it is a Chinese company, even if you change your settings to English. As a streaming service that allows its users to sing along to songs and make their own music videos, it is unique in that respect. Under the agreement, NetEase will make music from SMEs available to its users in the Chinese mainland. Music distribution, music streaming services, online karaoke, and music vlogs (Mlogs), were just some of the ways that SME and NetEase Cloud Music expanded their relationship together to bring more of an immersive experience to the younger music lovers of China. To broaden their music platform, they worked with SME to magnify the presence of Chinese artists but also global superstars, such as G.E.M., Karen Mok, Jolin Tsai, A-Lin, Nana-Ouyang, Sophia Huang, Eric Chou, and Evan Lin. William Lei Ding, Vice President of NetEase Cloud Music, said “With access to SME’s abundant catalogue of top artists across the globe, we’re thrilled to provide more unique and influential music content for our audience’s diverse tastes. The partnership will enrich and enliven our already vast and expanding library of quality music and propel China’s online music ecosystem forward. As leading companies in the music and entertainment industry, SME and NetEase are committed to providing music lovers with the ultimate audio experience and we look forward to working together with SME to explore more opportunities that benefit our vibrant community of music lovers.” It is evidently clear that Chinese online music is here to stay and even if it takes a little while to set up, the benefits of using this music streaming platform are second to none. It not only allows users to listen to music but is also a place where you can discuss music with others and give them recommendations. It is worth your time and money if you choose to subscribe. So, now you know a little bit more about the streaming service, maybe you want to try it out for yourself and start streaming!
