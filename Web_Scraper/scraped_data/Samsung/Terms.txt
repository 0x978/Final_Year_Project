Your status How the contract is formed between you and us 1. Your order is an offer to us to buy the Product(s) specified in your order. The Website provides you with a description of the Products which you may purchase. You are deemed to have placed an order with us once you have completed our online checkout process. After placing an order, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order and containing an Order Reference Number and details of the Product(s) you have ordered (“Order Confirmation”). Please note that the Order Confirmation is acknowledgment that we have received your order and does not mean your order has been accepted by us. All orders are subject to our acceptance of your offer to buy the Product(s) that you have ordered. If we have accepted your offer, we will send you an e-mail confirming that the Product has been dispatched (“Dispatch Confirmation”). 2. Sometimes we reject orders, for example we may refuse to accept your order: (a) where the Product is not available; (b) where we cannot obtain authorisation for your payment; (c) if there has been a pricing or Product description error (see ‘Price and Payment’ below); or (d) if you do not meet the eligibility criteria set out in ‘Your Status’ above. When this happens, we will let you know as soon as possible and refund any sums you have paid. 3. Before you enter into a contract with us, we will provide you with the following information: a. The total price of the Product(s), including any taxes; b. Any unavoidable costs associated with the contract, such as delivery or postal charges; c. Estimated delivery time; and, d. Arrangements for payment. 4. The contract is entered into between you and Samsung Electronics (UK) Limited (the “Contract”) and will only be formed upon the earlier of i) when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation or ii) delivery of the Product(s). 5. The Contract will relate only to those Products in respect of which we have confirmed dispatch in the Dispatch Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other Products which may have been part of your order until the dispatch of such Products has been confirmed in a separate Dispatch Confirmation. Order Confirmation Dispatch Confirmation Contract Links to Third Party Sites 14-day cooling-off period / right to return Availability, delivery and installation Installation services Risk and title 1. The Product(s) will be your responsibility from the time of delivery. 2. Ownership of the Product(s) will only pass to you on the later of either i) delivery or ii) when we receive: (a) full payment of all sums due in respect of the Products, including delivery charges; and (b) if you have agreed to trade-in a device, until we receive the traded-in device you have promised to provide us. 3. By signing for your order it is an acknowledgement of acceptance of the items. 4. We reserve the right to remotely disable the Product in certain circumstances including the following: (a) where you have reported the Product as lost or stolen; (b) where you have claimed a chargeback for your Product due to it not being delivered, or not being delivered as described; (c) where you have failed to provide us with a traded-in device which was promised to us as part of the purchase price through the Samsung Trade-In Programme. Price and payment 1. The price of the Product(s) will be as quoted on our Websites from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Product prices include VAT at the prevailing rate. The price quoted on our Websites for Product(s) excludes delivery charges which are quoted separately on our Websites. 2. Product prices and delivery charges are subject to change at any time, but changes will not affect orders in respect of which we have already sent you a Dispatch Confirmation. 3. Our Websites contain a large number of Product(s) and it is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the Product(s) listed on our Websites may be incorrectly priced. We will normally verify prices as part of our dispatch procedures so that, where a Product's correct price is less than our stated price, we will charge the lower amount when dispatching the Product to you. If a Product's correct price is higher than the price stated on our Websites, we will normally, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before dispatching the Product, or reject your order and notify you that we are rejecting it. If the price of the Product(s) is obviously an error and could have reasonably been recognised by you as an error, we do not have to provide the Product(s) to you at the incorrect (lower) price. 4. Payment can be made using all major credit and debit cards (American Express, Maestro, Mastercard, Visa Credit, and Visa Debit) and it is collected on our behalf by Adyen. Payment will be taken at the time of purchase or shortly after, unless you are pre-ordering, in which case payment will be taken within 28 days of you placing your order. Alternatively, other payment methods and credit facilities may be offered on the Websites for you to utilise to make your payment. These will have different terms and conditions that you will be asked to review and accept at the time you make payment. Returns Policy Refurbished products Warranty Faulty Products Our liability 1.
