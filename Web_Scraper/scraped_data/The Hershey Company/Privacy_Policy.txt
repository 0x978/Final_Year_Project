This Cookie & Ads Policy also describes our interest-based advertising practices and your choices. “Cookies” are small text files sent from a website and stored on your device. Cookies are used for various purposes, including to make site navigation more efficient, help remember your preferences, and improve your browsing experience. They can also enable the delivery of relevant and personalized advertisements. There are different types of cookies, which are distinguishable on the basis of their origin. “First-party cookies” are cookies that are stored by the website you are visiting, while “third-party cookies” are stored by a domain other than that of the website you are visiting. Cookies can also be distinguished on the basis of their functions and lifespan, as described below. Cookie Type Purpose of Use Strictly Necessary Cookies These cookies are necessary for the Website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions taken by you that amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in, placing items in your cart, or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the Website will not then work. Functional Cookies These cookies enable the Website to provide services or to remember settings to improve your visit. They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages, including social media platforms. For example, these cookies help us remember your choice of language or region, show you have logged in to the Website, or help you share information on a social media platform (e.g., Facebook). If you disable these cookies, some or all of these services may not function properly. Performance Cookies Targeting Cookies These cookies may be set through the Website by our advertising partners, including social media platforms. They may be used by our partners to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant advertisements on other online services, which is known as “interest-based advertising.” These cookies uniquely identify your browser and device and observe your behaviors and browsing activities over time across multiple websites or other platforms. For more information on interest-based advertising, please see Section 4 below. You can customize or change your cookie preferences at any time by accessing our cookie management system, available here. Additionally, your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other similar technologies or to reject cookies. Because the options you select relating to cookies and other similar technologies are browser and device specific, you must exercise your choices on each browser and device you use. The Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook “like” button, and widgets, such as the “share this” button or other interactive mini-programs. These features may collect your IP address and other data about your visit to the Website and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of the third parties that provide these services. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every service with which you interact. We engage in interest-based advertising to deliver online, relevant advertising to you. We also permit third-party online advertising networks, social media companies, and other third-party services to collect data about your use of the Website over time so that they may display advertisements tailored to you both on the Website and on third-party online services and across the devices you may use. Generally, the data used to deliver interest-based advertising to you is collected through cookies or other similar technologies. These technologies collect data about your browser and device (e.g., IP address, device ID, cookie ID, mobile advertising ID, general location information, and geolocation information (with your consent)) and your activity on the Website. These technologies may also collect similar data on other websites you visit and across the devices you use, and such data may be linked to certain online and offline data. In addition to serving interest-based advertisements, our third-party partners may use data to deliver certain advertising-related services, such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research. Some web browsers, websites/platforms, and mobile devices allow you to exercise certain choices with respect to interest-based advertising, as described below. Please note that you will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices, as each opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again. Even if you choose to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising, you may still receive advertising, but the advertisements may be less relevant. Some of our partners may provide you with additional choices with respect to interest-based advertising. For example, certain social media platforms allow you to control your advertising preferences directly through their services. Please review the privacy policies of the third-party services you use for more information. Depending on your U.S. state residency, our use and disclosure of Personal Data for interest-based advertising purposes constitutes “sharing” or the processing of Personal Data for “targeted advertising” under applicable law.
