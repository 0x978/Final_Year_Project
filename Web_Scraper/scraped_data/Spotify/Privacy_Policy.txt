Effective as of 5 December 2023 This Privacy Policy describes how we process your personal data at Spotify USA Inc. From now on, we'll call it the 'Policy'.

Other resources and settings Key information about your personal data is right here in this Policy. However, you might want to take a look at our other privacy resources and controls: On the 'Explicit Content' setting you can control whether explicit-rated content can be played on your Spotify account. Privacy laws give certain rights to individuals over their personal data. The table below explains: To verify a consumer request to know, request to delete, and request to correct, we ask you to provide certain details related to your Spotify account. Please note, if you do not have a Spotify account we will not have enough information about you to verify your identity and respond to your requests, as we do not keep sufficient information necessary to re-identify and link you to a prior visit to the Spotify Service where data may have been collected. As such, we will be unable to verify and honor your requests. If all the members of a household make an access, correction or deletion request, we will respond as if the requests are individual requests. What is tailored advertising? How to control tailored advertising: Appropriate age for tailored advertising: We receive some of the data mentioned above from third parties. The below table describes the categories of those third parties. If you download the Spotify mobile app and try Spotify using a logged out user experience, we will collect limited information about your usage of the Spotify Service, including Usage Data. We do this to understand how you are accessing and using the Service. We also do this to ensure we provide the right experience for you, for example based on your country or region. If you decide to create a Spotify account to experience our service in full, then we will combine this data with your Spotify account data. The table below sets out: This section sets out who receives personal data which is collected or generated through your use of the Spotify Service. Publicly available information The following personal data will always be publicly available on the Spotify Service (except to any user you have blocked): You or another user can share certain information on third party services, like social media or messaging platforms. This includes: When this sharing occurs, the third party service may store a copy of it to support their features. Personal data you may choose to disclose We will only disclose the following personal data with those outlined in the table below Information we may disclose See this table for details of who we disclose to and why. We keep your personal data only as long as necessary to provide you with the Spotify Service and for Spotify's legitimate and essential business purposes, such as: Here are some of the categories of our retention periods, and the criteria we use to determine them: Because of the global nature of our business, Spotify transfers personal data internationally with Spotify group companies, subcontractors and partners when carrying out the activities described in this Policy. Whenever we transfer personal data internationally, we use tools to make sure the data transfer complies with applicable law. We also identify and use additional protections as appropriate for each data transfer. For example, we use: We're committed to protecting our users' personal data. We put in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to help protect the security of your personal data. However, be aware that no system is ever completely secure. We have put various safeguards in place to guard against unauthorized access and unnecessary retention of personal data in our systems. These include pseudonymization, encryption, access, and retention policies. To protect your user account, we encourage you to: If other individuals have access to your Spotify account, then they can access personal data, controls and the Spotify Service available in your account. For example, you might have allowed someone to use your account on a shared device. It's your responsibility to only allow individuals to use your account where you're comfortable sharing this personal data with them. Anyone else's use of your Spotify account may impact your personalized recommendations and be included in your data download. The Spotify Service has a minimum 'Age Limit' in each country or region. The Spotify Service is not directed to children whose age: If we learn that we've collected the personal data of a child under the applicable Age Limit, we'll take reasonable steps to delete the personal data. This may require us to delete the Spotify account for that child. When using a shared device on the main Spotify Service, be cautious about playing or recommending any inappropriate content to individuals under 18 years old. We may occasionally make changes to this Policy. When we make material changes to this Policy, we'll provide you with prominent notice as appropriate under the circumstances. For example, we may display a prominent notice within the Spotify Service or send you an email or device notification.
