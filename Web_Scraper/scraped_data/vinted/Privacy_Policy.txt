Legal Basis For Processing For the purposes of Canadian law, we process your personal information with your consent except where otherwise permitted or required by law. We may also process your personal information on one or more of the following legal bases (as identified in section 4 (How we use personal information) above): Contract. The processing is necessary for our performance of the contract you have agreed to enter with us. If you do not provide your personal information to us, we will not be able to carry out our obligations under the terms of your contract. Legal Obligation. The processing of your personal information is necessary for the purposes of complying with applicable regulatory, accounting, and financial rules and obligations and to make mandatory disclosures to government bodies and law enforcement. Legitimate Interests. We are permitted to process your personal information if it is based on our “legitimate interests”, where we have good, sensible, practical reasons for processing your personal information, which is in the interests of Vinted and doesn’t outweigh your rights as data subjects. To do so, we have considered the impact on your interests and rights and have placed appropriate safeguards to ensure that the intrusion on your privacy is reduced as much as possible. In jurisdictions where “legitimate interests” are not a basis on which personal information may be processed, by providing us with personal information for an identified purpose, you consent to our processing it for that purpose. Where personal information is processed based on legitimate interests, e.g. for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object to such processing at any time and free of charge. See the section entitled “Your Legal Rights” to find out how. If you object to us processing your personal information, we must demonstrate compelling grounds for continuing to do so. Consent. For the purposes of Canadian law, your consent may be express or implied. Sometimes we want to use your personal information in a way that is entirely optional for you, such as to send you our promotions and news. On these occasions, you do not have to provide your consent. You can withdraw this consent at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions. 7. How We Share Information Vinted will not share personal information with any third parties for the third parties’ use for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. Vinted may provide personal information to Vinted service providers, vendors, subcontractors, and professional advisers (who are located in North America, the UK, or the EU and bound by privacy obligations) to assist us in carrying out the uses of information described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we use services from third parties that help us by: providing cloud and hosting services, processing payments and refunds, providing and maintaining tools for customer relationship management, providing customer support services to our users, delivering a purchase, helping us gather and analyze analytical data, enabling us to collect feedback from you, providing a phone verification service, providing IT security, maintenance, and technical services, and providing communication and newsletter sending services. When you make a purchase from another user, they receive the following personal information: first and last name, shipping method, delivery address (street, number, addition, postal code, city, province, country) or pickup point (address), order price, paid shipping costs, and shipping label. We may also share your personal information with third parties if we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to: conduct investigations of possible breaches of law, identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating an agreement they have with us, protect our rights, safety, or property, or carry out any other purpose permitted or required by law. We may also share your personal information when we investigate security breaches or cooperate with government authorities pursuant to a legal matter. We reserve the right to transfer any personal information we have in the event that we merge with or are acquired by a third party or should any such transaction be proposed. Additionally, we share data within the Vinted group for the performance of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Vinted may share your data with third parties when transferring rights and obligations pertaining to the contractual relationship between you and Vinted to such third parties in accordance with the Terms of Use (available via the https://vinted.ca/en/terms-and-conditions), in particular in the case of the transfer of a sector of activity, a merger through the foundation of a new company, a merger through absorption, de-merger, or any change in control affecting Vinted. 8. What About Information I Disclose Publicly? The Platform permits you to publicly share or otherwise submit ideas, photographs, information about items you wish to sell or purchase, information about your location, questions, comments, suggestions, or other content including personal information (collectively, “User Content”). Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including personal information, in connection with your User Content. Please note that Vinted does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. Similarly, you should be careful what information you share directly with another user using any chat or messaging features on the Platform. You should be especially careful when you share your location or choose to meet another user. You should not share your payment information directly with other users. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Platform or share with other users or what others do with information you share with them on the website. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the website. 9. We May Transfer Personal Information To Other Countries We may also hold your personal information on select third-party cloud-based servers in the United States or other jurisdictions. We may also use service providers in other countries to process or store personal information. This means that some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located in Canada, the UK and European Economic Area, the United States, and the Netherlands. These countries’ data protection laws may differ from those of the jurisdiction in which you live. Personal information processed or stored in another jurisdiction may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in accordance with the laws of that jurisdiction. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the personal information that are consistent with those that apply in Canada and compliant with applicable data protection laws. 10. Security Our security is intended to help protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and any other unlawful forms of processing. We use technical, physical, and organizational measures to help protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and any other unlawful forms of processing. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization or our third-party service providers or third parties (such as law enforcement) who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or who are otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. Personal information we collect is maintained in Canada. Although we have taken measures to protect our Platform, our computer systems, and personal information that we have collected from unauthorized use, access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction, no security measures can provide absolute protection. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. 11. Retention Period We retain personal information that we collect as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to meet any legal requirements, including applicable limitation periods. We have retention standards which meet these requirements. Most of the information we collect is retained for the life of your account until it is either deleted or has been inactive for a period of 2.5 years. After this, your account is closed. When your account is closed, we will either delete or render anonymous most of the associated information. We may keep certain records longer where permitted or required by law. For example, we may retain Financial Information for up to 10 years. 12. Your Legal Rights You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. To help protect against fraudulent requests, and in compliance with the local data protection legislation, we may ask you for specific information to allow us to confirm that the person making the request is you or is authorized to access your information before granting your request. For example, we may require you to verify your identity before you access your personal information. You can exercise these rights free of charge by contacting us (please see Section 19: Company Contact Information of this Privacy Policy). Please be aware that there are exceptions and exemptions that apply to some of these rights, which we will apply in accordance with the data protection laws. You have the right to: Access your personal information. You have a right (subject to limited exceptions under relevant data protection laws) to request access to your personal information. Individuals may send requests to review their personal information contained in Vinted files to the Vinted privacy officer using the contact information provided in the below section, “Company Contact Information/Data Protection Officer”. To help us find the information, please give us as much information as possible about the type of personal data you would like to see. Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no sufficient reason for us continuing to process it. You may also ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, as permitted under the local data protection laws. You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal information for profiling and direct marketing purposes. Request restriction of processing of your personal information This enables you to ask us to stop the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it, as allowed under the local data protection laws. Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or if we used the information to carry out a contract with you. Withdraw consent at any time if we are relying on consent to process your personal information, in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation and subject to applicable exceptions. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. For individuals subject to Canadian law, if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us using the contact methods and details set out in the below section “Company Contact Information/Data Protection Officer”.

Vinted may disclose personal information to another entity purchasing (including, but not limited to, for diligence purposes prior to purchase) the assets of (or otherwise acquiring) Vinted provided that entity abides by this or a similar privacy policy. 13.

We use this information to improve our Platform and services, including to analyze Platform usage to improve user-friendliness and to track down and prevent fraud and security issues. If you are suspended from the Platform, we may use your IP address to enforce the suspension. We may work with third parties, including Google, to collect this information. We utilize Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager to track user information such as user location as inferred from IP address, the amount of time a visitor spends on our Platform, which pages are more frequently accessed, how the Platform is accessed (either directly, a search engine, or from a link), what sort of software is used (e.g.: operating system, browser type, etc.), as well as demographics. Google Analytics uses IP addresses to determine unique visitors and general geolocation data. Google offers an opt-out mechanism here (https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) and offers the ability to alter your ad settings here (https://www.google.com/settings/ads/anonymous). For more information about cookies, tracking, and how we use tracking technologies on our website, please visit our Cookie Policy. 6. Legal Basis For Processing For the purposes of Canadian law, we process your personal information with your consent except where otherwise permitted or required by law. We may also process your personal information on one or more of the following legal bases (as identified in section 4 (How we use personal information) above): Contract. The processing is necessary for our performance of the contract you have agreed to enter with us. If you do not provide your personal information to us, we will not be able to carry out our obligations under the terms of your contract. Legal Obligation. The processing of your personal information is necessary for the purposes of complying with applicable regulatory, accounting, and financial rules and obligations and to make mandatory disclosures to government bodies and law enforcement. Legitimate Interests. We are permitted to process your personal information if it is based on our “legitimate interests”, where we have good, sensible, practical reasons for processing your personal information, which is in the interests of Vinted and doesn’t outweigh your rights as data subjects. To do so, we have considered the impact on your interests and rights and have placed appropriate safeguards to ensure that the intrusion on your privacy is reduced as much as possible. In jurisdictions where “legitimate interests” are not a basis on which personal information may be processed, by providing us with personal information for an identified purpose, you consent to our processing it for that purpose. Where personal information is processed based on legitimate interests, e.g. for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object to such processing at any time and free of charge. See the section entitled “Your Legal Rights” to find out how. If you object to us processing your personal information, we must demonstrate compelling grounds for continuing to do so. Consent. For the purposes of Canadian law, your consent may be express or implied. Sometimes we want to use your personal information in a way that is entirely optional for you, such as to send you our promotions and news. On these occasions, you do not have to provide your consent. You can withdraw this consent at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions. 7. How We Share Information Vinted will not share personal information with any third parties for the third parties’ use for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. Vinted may provide personal information to Vinted service providers, vendors, subcontractors, and professional advisers (who are located in North America, the UK, or the EU and bound by privacy obligations) to assist us in carrying out the uses of information described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we use services from third parties that help us by: providing cloud and hosting services, processing payments and refunds, providing and maintaining tools for customer relationship management, providing customer support services to our users, delivering a purchase, helping us gather and analyze analytical data, enabling us to collect feedback from you, providing a phone verification service, providing IT security, maintenance, and technical services, and providing communication and newsletter sending services. When you make a purchase from another user, they receive the following personal information: first and last name, shipping method, delivery address (street, number, addition, postal code, city, province, country) or pickup point (address), order price, paid shipping costs, and shipping label. We may also share your personal information with third parties if we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to: conduct investigations of possible breaches of law, identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating an agreement they have with us, protect our rights, safety, or property, or carry out any other purpose permitted or required by law. We may also share your personal information when we investigate security breaches or cooperate with government authorities pursuant to a legal matter. We reserve the right to transfer any personal information we have in the event that we merge with or are acquired by a third party or should any such transaction be proposed. Additionally, we share data within the Vinted group for the performance of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Vinted may share your data with third parties when transferring rights and obligations pertaining to the contractual relationship between you and Vinted to such third parties in accordance with the Terms of Use (available via the https://vinted.ca/en/terms-and-conditions), in particular in the case of the transfer of a sector of activity, a merger through the foundation of a new company, a merger through absorption, de-merger, or any change in control affecting Vinted. 8. What About Information I Disclose Publicly? The Platform permits you to publicly share or otherwise submit ideas, photographs, information about items you wish to sell or purchase, information about your location, questions, comments, suggestions, or other content including personal information (collectively, “User Content”). Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including personal information, in connection with your User Content. Please note that Vinted does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. Similarly, you should be careful what information you share directly with another user using any chat or messaging features on the Platform. You should be especially careful when you share your location or choose to meet another user. You should not share your payment information directly with other users. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Platform or share with other users or what others do with information you share with them on the website. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the website. 9. We May Transfer Personal Information To Other Countries We may also hold your personal information on select third-party cloud-based servers in the United States or other jurisdictions. We may also use service providers in other countries to process or store personal information. This means that some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located in Canada, the UK and European Economic Area, the United States, and the Netherlands. These countries’ data protection laws may differ from those of the jurisdiction in which you live. Personal information processed or stored in another jurisdiction may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in accordance with the laws of that jurisdiction. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the personal information that are consistent with those that apply in Canada and compliant with applicable data protection laws. 10. Security Our security is intended to help protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and any other unlawful forms of processing. We use technical, physical, and organizational measures to help protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and any other unlawful forms of processing. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization or our third-party service providers or third parties (such as law enforcement) who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or who are otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. Personal information we collect is maintained in Canada. Although we have taken measures to protect our Platform, our computer systems, and personal information that we have collected from unauthorized use, access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction, no security measures can provide absolute protection. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. 11. Retention Period We retain personal information that we collect as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to meet any legal requirements, including applicable limitation periods. We have retention standards which meet these requirements. Most of the information we collect is retained for the life of your account until it is either deleted or has been inactive for a period of 2.5 years. After this, your account is closed. When your account is closed, we will either delete or render anonymous most of the associated information. We may keep certain records longer where permitted or required by law. For example, we may retain Financial Information for up to 10 years. 12. Your Legal Rights You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. To help protect against fraudulent requests, and in compliance with the local data protection legislation, we may ask you for specific information to allow us to confirm that the person making the request is you or is authorized to access your information before granting your request. For example, we may require you to verify your identity before you access your personal information. You can exercise these rights free of charge by contacting us (please see Section 19: Company Contact Information of this Privacy Policy). Please be aware that there are exceptions and exemptions that apply to some of these rights, which we will apply in accordance with the data protection laws.

To help us find the information, please give us as much information as possible about the type of personal data you would like to see. Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us. Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no sufficient reason for us continuing to process it. You may also ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully, or where we are required to erase your personal information to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request. Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your interests, rights, and freedoms, as permitted under the local data protection laws. You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal information for profiling and direct marketing purposes. Request restriction of processing of your personal information This enables you to ask us to stop the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it, as allowed under the local data protection laws. Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or if we used the information to carry out a contract with you. Withdraw consent at any time if we are relying on consent to process your personal information, in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation and subject to applicable exceptions. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. For individuals subject to Canadian law, if you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.

Legal Basis For Processing For the purposes of Canadian law, we process your personal information with your consent except where otherwise permitted or required by law. We may also process your personal information on one or more of the following legal bases (as identified in section 4 (How we use personal information) above): Contract.

The processing of your personal information is necessary for the purposes of complying with applicable regulatory, accounting, and financial rules and obligations and to make mandatory disclosures to government bodies and law enforcement. Legal Obligation. Legitimate Interests. We are permitted to process your personal information if it is based on our “legitimate interests”, where we have good, sensible, practical reasons for processing your personal information, which is in the interests of Vinted and doesn’t outweigh your rights as data subjects. To do so, we have considered the impact on your interests and rights and have placed appropriate safeguards to ensure that the intrusion on your privacy is reduced as much as possible. In jurisdictions where “legitimate interests” are not a basis on which personal information may be processed, by providing us with personal information for an identified purpose, you consent to our processing it for that purpose. Where personal information is processed based on legitimate interests, e.g. for the purposes of direct marketing, you have the right to object to such processing at any time and free of charge. See the section entitled “Your Legal Rights” to find out how. If you object to us processing your personal information, we must demonstrate compelling grounds for continuing to do so. Legitimate Interests. Consent. For the purposes of Canadian law, your consent may be express or implied. Sometimes we want to use your personal information in a way that is entirely optional for you, such as to send you our promotions and news. On these occasions, you do not have to provide your consent. You can withdraw this consent at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions. Consent. 7. How We Share Information Vinted will not share personal information with any third parties for the third parties’ use for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. Vinted may provide personal information to Vinted service providers, vendors, subcontractors, and professional advisers (who are located in North America, the UK, or the EU and bound by privacy obligations) to assist us in carrying out the uses of information described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we use services from third parties that help us by: providing cloud and hosting services, processing payments and refunds, providing and maintaining tools for customer relationship management, providing customer support services to our users, delivering a purchase, helping us gather and analyze analytical data, enabling us to collect feedback from you, providing a phone verification service, providing IT security, maintenance, and technical services, and providing communication and newsletter sending services. providing cloud and hosting services, processing payments and refunds, providing and maintaining tools for customer relationship management, providing customer support services to our users, delivering a purchase, helping us gather and analyze analytical data, enabling us to collect feedback from you, providing a phone verification service, providing IT security, maintenance, and technical services, and providing communication and newsletter sending services.

Additionally, we share data within the Vinted group for the performance of the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Vinted may share your data with third parties when transferring rights and obligations pertaining to the contractual relationship between you and Vinted to such third parties in accordance with the Terms of Use (available via the https://vinted.ca/en/terms-and-conditions), in particular in the case of the transfer of a sector of activity, a merger through the foundation of a new company, a merger through absorption, de-merger, or any change in control affecting Vinted. 8. What About Information I Disclose Publicly? The Platform permits you to publicly share or otherwise submit ideas, photographs, information about items you wish to sell or purchase, information about your location, questions, comments, suggestions, or other content including personal information (collectively, “User Content”). Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including personal information, in connection with your User Content. User Content Please note that Vinted does not control who will have access to the information that you choose to make public and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. Similarly, you should be careful what information you share directly with another user using any chat or messaging features on the Platform. You should be especially careful when you share your location or choose to meet another user. You should not share your payment information directly with other users. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any information that you make publicly available on the Platform or share with other users or what others do with information you share with them on the website. We are not responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties through the website. 9. We May Transfer Personal Information To Other Countries We may also hold your personal information on select third-party cloud-based servers in the United States or other jurisdictions. We may also use service providers in other countries to process or store personal information. This means that some or all of the personal information we collect may be stored or processed on servers located in Canada, the UK and European Economic Area, the United States, and the Netherlands. These countries’ data protection laws may differ from those of the jurisdiction in which you live. Personal information processed or stored in another jurisdiction may be subject to access requests from governments, courts, or law enforcement in accordance with the laws of that jurisdiction. Subject to applicable laws in such other jurisdictions, we will use reasonable efforts to ensure that appropriate protections are in place to require the data processor in that country to maintain protections on the personal information that are consistent with those that apply in Canada and compliant with applicable data protection laws. 10. Security Our security is intended to help protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and any other unlawful forms of processing. We use technical, physical, and organizational measures to help protect against accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss or alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, and any other unlawful forms of processing. Personal information may be accessed by persons within our organization or our third-party service providers or third parties (such as law enforcement) who require such access to carry out the purposes indicated above, or who are otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. Personal information we collect is maintained in Canada. Although we have taken measures to protect our Platform, our computer systems, and personal information that we have collected from unauthorized use, access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction, no security measures can provide absolute protection. As a result, while we are committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you provide to us. 11. Retention Period We retain personal information that we collect as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or to meet any legal requirements, including applicable limitation periods. We have retention standards which meet these requirements. Most of the information we collect is retained for the life of your account until it is either deleted or has been inactive for a period of 2.5 years. After this, your account is closed. When your account is closed, we will either delete or render anonymous most of the associated information. We may keep certain records longer where permitted or required by law. For example, we may retain Financial Information for up to 10 years. 12. Your Legal Rights You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal information. To help protect against fraudulent requests, and in compliance with the local data protection legislation, we may ask you for specific information to allow us to confirm that the person making the request is you or is authorized to access your information before granting your request. For example, we may require you to verify your identity before you access your personal information. You can exercise these rights free of charge by contacting us (please see Section 19: Company Contact Information of this Privacy Policy).

This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no sufficient reason for us continuing to process it.

Request erasure Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

You also have the right to object to our processing of your personal information for profiling and direct marketing purposes. Object to processing Request restriction of processing of your personal information This enables you to ask us to stop the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful, but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data, but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it, as allowed under the local data protection laws. Request restriction Request the transfer of your personal information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

Request the transfer Withdraw consent at any time if we are relying on consent to process your personal information, in accordance with the applicable data protection legislation and subject to applicable exceptions.

We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
