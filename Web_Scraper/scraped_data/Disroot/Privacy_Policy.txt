Privacy Statement v1.4 - April 2023  This document has been originally written in English and is the only version for which Stichting Disroot.org can be held accountable. Any translation of this Privacy Statement is a community effort to make the information accessible in other languages and should be taken as such, with no other value than merely informative. If a user chooses to use any of the services provided by us, the following data will be required and therefore collected by Disroot.org: To protect your data we use the following security measures: In order to allow attempt at recovery from dataloss disaster situations, we create backups on remote server owned by Stichting Disroot.org. We backup data on daily basis and store them for period of 7 days. Exception from this rule applies to emails stored in mailboxes and files uploaded to Disroot cloud. Due to the size of that data, backups take considerable longer and cannot be completed on daily basis. Instead, we keep 7 last versions of the backup made. We store all data in our own servers, located in a data center in the Netherlands. Under the GDPR you have a number of rights with regard to your personal data: Your Disroot username and Disroot email address are integral part of your user account and cannot be modified. Usernames remain in the database, even after erasure request, to prevent old usernames being re-used by new users, compromising the privacy of both and enabling possible identity theft. For that reason, usernames of accounts that have been deleted remain in the database to avoid being reused. However, all the linked personal information is deleted permanently. You have the right to lodge a complain, make enquires, excercise any of the rights described above or withdraw your consent to the processing of your Data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your Data), by contacting us via email to: For the purposes of the GDPR, Disroot.org is the "data controller".
