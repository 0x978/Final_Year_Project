Lightyear Europe AS is a licensed investment firm and as such is bound by strict regulatory obligations in how we handle and protect your assets. We do this via a process known as safeguarding.Safeguarding means that, by law:Uninvested customer funds are stored separately from our business funds with regulated EU credit institutions and highest rated money market funds. The primary institutions where we hold uninvested customer funds are ABN AMRO Bank in the Netherlands and AS LHV Pank in Estonia, and in BlackRock money market funds rated AAA/mmf by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch.Invested assets are held with authorised custodians, which you can read more about in our “Who is the owner of the securities I buy?” help article.All customers assets are inaccessible by our creditors and they would be returned to customers in the unlikely event of Lightyears insolvency.Are Lightyear customers covered by EU wide asset guarantee schemes?Yes, should Lightyear Europe default, all our customers have their assets covered up to the amount of 20,000 EUR by the Estonian Investor Protection Sectoral Fund. Read more about this fund here.Am I covered by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) protection in the US?Your US securities are held with our partner Alpaca, who is FINRA regulated and a registered member of the SIPC. This means your US securities are protected up to the value of $500,000 should Alpaca fail. You can read more about this directly on the SIPC website.Do UK users benefit from Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) protection?Lightyear customers are not covered by FSCS protection as funds are currently held under our EU entity that provides brokerage services to customers resident in the UK. Access to FSCS protection will be reviewed once Lightyear is directly authorised by the FCA. Our direct authorisation application is currently with the FCA and we are working hard to finalise proceedings. You can read more about this in our How is Lightyear regulated? help article.What is a money market fund?Money Market funds (MMFs) are a type of mutual fund that invests only in highly liquid, short-term debt from the likes of governments and financial institutions. These funds offer high liquidity with a very low level of risk and EU/UK regulations allow for brokerages to hold customer money in them. In addition to offering protection via diversification, MMFs provide a return which we pass on to customers in the form of interest payments on uninvested cash you hold in your Lightyear account.To opt-out from keeping your money in a MMF, you can opt-out of interest in the app.How does interest work?You can hold uninvested money on your multi-currency account that can also earn interest.Like most brokers, Lightyear earns interest on the cash it holds on your behalf in institutional bank accounts that are designed for financial firms to hold their customers’ money, as well as from holding your money in MMFs. Lightyear gets paid interest for holding customers money and at a rate typically not available to retail customers. We have decided to pay this forward to you transparently.The amount of interest earned is based on the current per annum (per year) base interest rate — from which we’ll take a transparent 0.75% cut. See our pricing page for the current interest rates.Calculation and paymentYou’ll start earning interest daily, on the same day as your deposit hits your Lightyear account.We calculate the unpaid interest daily on the available uninvested cash balance of your investment account to five decimal places using the latest Lightyear rate. We then sum and round the unpaid interest amounts to two decimal places. Interest payments will be credited to your Lightyear account on the first of every month, and you can see the interest that you have been paid in the latest version of the Lightyear app and in your statements.Money that’s been reserved for orders or other reasons does not accrue interest, and if you close your account before the next interest payment date, it won’t be paid out.TaxesPlease note you’ll be responsible for the appropriate tax reporting and payments, in accordance with your local tax laws. You can opt-out from earning interest by navigating to “Earn Interest” under the Settings page, which will cause any unpaid interest to be forfeited.ProtectionEarning interest on your uninvested money does not change the way your money is segregated or safeguarded. We always hold our customers’ uninvested money in segregated client money accounts in regulated EU credit institutions and highest rated* money market funds, which you can read more about in our article "How are my assets protected?".It is important to note that the funds held in your Lightyear account are not equivalent to a bank deposit, and therefore in the unlikely event that all appropriate safeguards fail, funds are ultimately protected by the Investor Protection Sectoral Fund only for amounts up to 20,000 EUR in total across all your multi-currency account balances.
