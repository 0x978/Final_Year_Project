We believe in:Radical transparency: We’ll always be upfront with any associated charges. We also want to ensure that we charge the smallest amount possible fairly, so if you place an order where the fees will account for 5% or more of its total value, you’ll be presented with a pop-up in the Lightyear app for you to confirm this.Honest pricing: Our fees are a combination of covering the costs associated with the service plus a small amount on top that we can reinvest to improve the businessApplicable taxes:Financial Transaction TaxA financial transaction tax (FTT) is when a percentage of the asset's value is paid in taxes when traded.

The protections mentioned in this article do not cover poor investment performance. It’s important to always remember that markets may go up or down, so you should never invest more than you can afford to lose. Trusting us with your investments is not something we take for granted. Lightyear Europe AS is a licensed investment firm and as such is bound by strict regulatory obligations in how we handle and protect your assets. We do this via a process known as safeguarding. Safeguarding means that, by law: Money Market funds (MMFs) are a type of mutual fund that invests only in highly liquid, short-term debt from the likes of governments and financial institutions. These funds offer high liquidity with a very low level of risk and EU/UK regulations allow for brokerages to hold customer money in them. In addition to offering protection via diversification, MMFs provide a return which we pass on to customers in the form of interest payments on uninvested cash you hold in your Lightyear account. To opt-out from keeping your money in a MMF, you can opt-out of interest in the app. You can hold uninvested money on your multi-currency account that can also earn interest. Like most brokers, Lightyear earns interest on the cash it holds on your behalf in institutional bank accounts that are designed for financial firms to hold their customers’ money, as well as from holding your money in MMFs. Lightyear gets paid interest for holding customers money and at a rate typically not available to retail customers. We have decided to pay this forward to you transparently. Please note you’ll be responsible for the appropriate tax reporting and payments, in accordance with your local tax laws. You can opt-out from earning interest by navigating to “Earn Interest” under the Settings page, which will cause any unpaid interest to be forfeited. It is important to note that the funds held in your Lightyear account are not equivalent to a bank deposit, and therefore in the unlikely event that all appropriate safeguards fail, funds are ultimately protected by the Investor Protection Sectoral Fund only for amounts up to 20,000 EUR in total across all your multi-currency account balances. Funds are not covered by the Deposit Guarantee Sectoral Fund, as it only covers bank deposits. *rated AAA/mmf by Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Lightyear is a simple and approachable way to invest your money globally without unnecessary barriers or fees.

If you’ve already made a bank transfer into your Lightyear account, your bank account is saved to your profile and you can withdraw without any extra steps. In case you’ve deposited using Apple/Google Pay or Debit card options, we don’t have your bank account details yet, so keep them at hand and the app will guide you through how to add them.
