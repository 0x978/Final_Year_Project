Community - Terms of use At Vivaldi Technologies AS (“Vivaldi”), we try to keep things as simple and easy as possible, but since this is a legal document, it’s a bit longer than we would like it to be. It’s important that you read this carefully and understand the Terms of Use. By using Vivaldi services, you agree to the following terms and conditions, which apply to all Vivaldi services (webmail, blogs, forums, sync, social and themes) made available to the Vivaldi Community. What you agree not to do We do our best to provide the best community environment; however, we cannot be liable for any kind of damage, direct or consequential, resulting from your use of our Website. We do not guarantee that access to our Website will always be available or uninterrupted. The Website and all the Website elements are provided on an “as is” basis. This means that we cannot guarantee the accuracy and timeliness of information available. We are not responsible or liable for content or services provided by any third-parties, that may be used on or linked from the Website. Please note that the email quota is of 5GB. As soon as your account reaches critical size, Vivaldi will send you a warning message. An account that has exceeded the quota limit will be blocked from receiving mail and from storing new messages. In such a case, you will not be able to send or receive mail. Please note that if you delete your data, including but not limited to your topics and comments on the forum, we will not be able to restore it for you. The content and material you publish on our forums, blogs, social and themes is yours only, and Vivaldi does not claim ownership to any of your uploads. We only use, copy, display, distribute and adapt your content for the purpose of running the forums, social and blog services. By accepting these Terms of Use through your continued use of the services, you grant Vivaldi an irrevocable license to do so. You can choose to end the agreement at any time, for any reason, by deleting your Vivaldi account and discontinuing your use of the services. When doing so, your data is permanently deleted from all our servers, and your username can never be re-used. We may suspend or terminate your access to the services or remove any of your content at any time for any reason (not limited to the list below), if we reasonably believe: If you violate any of the Terms, in addition to your account being suspended or terminated, you may be exposed to civil and criminal sanctions. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you by the email address associated with your Vivaldi account or the next time you attempt to access the Services. We encourage people to actively log in and use Vivaldi services when they register an account. To keep your account active, be sure to log in at least once every 6 months. Accounts and their contents may be permanently removed due to prolonged inactivity. Vivaldi has a zero-tolerance policy against child sexual abuse imagery. If we become aware of such content, we will report it to the Norwegian Police Department, as required by law. We may also take disciplinary action, including termination, against the Vivaldi Mail accounts of those involved.
