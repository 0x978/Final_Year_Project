In the event of a Dispute, you or WEBTOON must give the other a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and a proposed solution (a “Notice of Dispute”). You must send any Notice of Dispute by registered mail to WEBTOON at Pangyo TechONE Tower1 11-12F, 131, Bundangnaegok-ro, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea Attention: Legal Department and also via e-mail to dl_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com. WEBTOON will send any Notice of Dispute to you by e-mail address or registered mail to your address if WEBTOON has it. You and WEBTOON will attempt to resolve any Dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or WEBTOON may commence arbitration. An arbitrator will decide any disputes over whether this subsection has been violated, and has the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitrator shall not administer any arbitration unless the requirements of this subsection have been met.

b) Mediation, Binding Arbitration and Governing Law. You and WEBTOON shall endeavor to settle any Dispute by mediation under the Mediation Rules of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. (“JAMS”). The place of mediation shall be Los Angeles, California. Any Dispute which has not been resolved by mediation as provided herein within thirty (30) days after appointment of a mediator or such time period as you or WEBTOON may otherwise agree, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration as described in this Section 17. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all Disputes in court before a judge or jury. Instead, all Disputes will be resolved before a neutral arbitrator, whose decision will be final except for a limited right of appeal under the Federal Arbitration Act. The arbitrator shall decide all issues pertaining to arbitrability, including his or her own jurisdictional validity and enforceability of the Agreement (e.g., unconscionability). For the avoidance of doubt, this is not meant to reduce any powers granted to the arbitrator under the applicable JAMS rules. The place of arbitration shall be Los Angeles, California. Any court with jurisdiction over the parties may enforce the arbitrator’s award.

c) Class Action Waiver. Any proceedings to resolve or litigate any Dispute in any forum will be conducted solely on an individual basis. Neither you nor WEBTOON will seek to have any Dispute heard as a class action or in any other proceeding in which either party acts or proposes to act in a representative capacity. No arbitration or proceeding will be combined with another without the prior written consent of all parties to all affected arbitrations or proceedings. Class actions and class arbitrations are not permitted; for example, you may bring a claim only on your own behalf and cannot seek relief that would affect other Service users. Nor may an arbitrator consolidate arbitrations unless all parties agree. If there is a final judicial determination that the limitations of this paragraph are unenforceable as to a particular claim or a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief), then the parties agree that such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court after all other claims and requests for relief are arbitrated.

d) Mass Arbitrations. If 25 or more claimants submit similar Notices of Dispute or file similar arbitrations and are represented by the same or coordinated counsel, all of the cases must be resolved in arbitration in stages using staged bellwether proceedings. You agree to do this even though the resolution of some claims might be delayed. In the first stage, the parties shall select up to 10 cases to be filed in arbitration and resolved by separate arbitrators. In the meantime, no other cases may be filed in arbitration. Nor may the arbitration provider accept, administer or demand payment for fees for other arbitrations. If the remaining cases are not settled after the first stage is done, the parties will repeat the process. These staged bellwether proceedings will continue until all cases are resolved. If this subsection applies to a Notice of Dispute, any statute of limitations applicable to the listed claims will be tolled from the time the first cases are selected for bellwether proceedings until the claimant’s Notice of Dispute is selected for a bellwether proceeding or otherwise resolved. A court will have the authority to enforce this subsection, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations or assessment of related fees.

e) Arbitration Procedures. Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”) in effect at the time the Dispute is filed. You may request a telephonic or in-person hearing by following the JAMS Rules. In a dispute involving $10,000 or less, any hearing will be telephonic unless the arbitrator finds good cause to hold an in-person hearing instead. To the extent the forum provided by JAMS is unavailable, WEBTOON and you agree to select a mutually agreeable alternative dispute resolution service and that such alternative dispute resolution service shall apply the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator may award the same damages to you individually as a court could. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only to you individually, and only to the extent required to satisfy your individual claim.

f) Arbitration Fees. Whoever files the arbitration pays the initial filing fee. If WEBTOON files, then WEBTOON will pay; if you file, then you will pay unless you get a fee waiver under the applicable arbitration rules. Each party will bear the expense of that party’s attorneys, experts, and witnesses, and other expenses, regardless of which party prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses (including attorney’s fees) from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.

g) Filing Period. To the extent permitted by law, any Dispute under the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year in an arbitration proceeding. The one-year period begins on the earliest date when any of the alleged claims first accrue, regardless of whether additional damages occur after such claims first accrue. If a Dispute is not filed within one year, it is permanently barred.

h) Opt-Out. You can opt out of arbitration within 30 days of the date that you first agreed to the Agreement (including any earlier version). If you have previously agreed to arbitration, then you may opt out of any future revisions to the arbitration provision within 30 days of receiving notice of the updated arbitration provision, in which case the prior version of the arbitration shall apply. To opt out of arbitration (or revisions to this arbitration provision), you must send your name, residence address, username, email address or phone number you use for your Services account, and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this arbitration agreement (or of the revisions to it), and you must send them here: dl_wlegalnotice@webtoonscorp.com.
