We do not collect, sell, license, share any data (personally identifiable or otherwise) from the Rethink DNS + Firewall Android app.

The app is free of any trackers, spyware, ads, or loggers whatsoever. This can be, to an extent, ascertained from our code which is open-source on GitHub.
The app does not use or depend on or embed any third-party services in its default setting. The only exception is Google PlayStore (see their privacy policy) which is used as an app distribution channel.
The app does not collect any debug or diagnostic data unless you explicitly choose to share it with us, for example, over email.

We do not collect, sell, license, share any data (including cookies) from our any of our web pages at rethinkdns.com.
